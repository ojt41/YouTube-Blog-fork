Hey Chris,

I enjoyed our chat yesterday!

Here are some key points from our conversation.
- You will see a significant improvement in system performance when you upgrade to Claude 3.7 (this will likely be the biggest lift)
- An easy way to improve your prompts is to have the inference model (e.g. Claude 3.7) rewrite the current versions
- A more effective way to improve your prompts is to provide 3-5 examples to the inference model and have it write a prompt from scratch to generate reports in the format and style of the examples.
- You can mitigate hallucinations by using a faithfulness score to identify failure modes and then update your prompt to handle them.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to help.

Cheers,

P.S. Anthropic's [prompt engineering guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) is a great resource to improve your prompt templates
