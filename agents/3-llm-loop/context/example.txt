🚀 Unlock AI-Powered Automation Without the Overhead of a Full Dev Team

You know AI has potential—but between the jargon, hype, and tools that only half-deliver, it's hard to know where to start.

❌ Still doing manual, repetitive work
❌ Using tools that don't quite fit your workflow
❌ Struggling to connect data sources or build prototypes
❌ Not sure how to apply AI to your business problems

✅ That’s where I come in.

I help founders, teams, and consultants build custom, scalable AI-powered tools that solve real business problems—without the fluff.

🛠 What I Build:
• AI Agents & Assistants – Custom GPT-4o powered workflows tailored to your business
• Automation Scripts – Web scraping, email drafting, document parsing, API integrations
• LLM-Powered Search – RAG systems, semantic search, Q&A over your internal docs
• Dashboards & Insights – Visualizations and reporting powered by Python & AI
• Custom Chatbots – Trained on your content, deployed to your site or app
• Data Pipelines – End-to-end ETL for analytics or model training
• Lightweight SaaS Tools – MVPs built using Streamlit, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL

💡 How I Work:
I’m not just an engineer—I’m a strategist. I help you figure out what’s worth building and why, then actually make it happen. My workflow includes:
• Business-first scoping sessions
• Clear milestones with working prototypes
• Fast, clean Python code (you own it)
• Loom walkthroughs and async check-ins

🏆 Why Clients Work With Me:
• Built AI-powered internal tools used by 20+ enterprise teams
• 100% Job Success | Expert-Vetted | US-Based
• Former Data Scientist + Consultant | 10+ years experience
• Clients include funded startups, solo consultants, and multi-billion dollar orgs

💬 What People Say:
“Delivered a working prototype within days—then iterated with real feedback. Best experience I've had on Upwork.”

💥 NOT a good fit if:
• You’re looking for the cheapest option
• You don’t have a clear business outcome in mind
• You want to outsource the thinking, not just the building

✅ GREAT fit if:
• You have a use case or idea and need a fast, functional implementation
• You want someone who gets both AI + business
• You value clean, modular code you can own and scale
