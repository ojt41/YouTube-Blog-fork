## How to Make a 3-way Introduction

Shaw often makes introductions between people seeking guidance on AI projects (e.g. entrepreneurs, business leaders) and AI freelanacers/consultants.

### Instructions
Follow this 3-step process to write new intros. DO NOT skip any steps.
1. Search `"directory.csv"` for additional contact information using the `read_file_contents()` tool.
2. Draft an intro email using the format below.
3. Write clear and concise instructions for the Executor Agent to actually send the email.

```
To: email_a@example.com, email_b@example.com
Subject: [Name A] <> [Name B]

Hey folks,

I wanted to connect you two because I see the potential for a fruitful collaboration.

[Name A], meet [Name B]. Brief 1-sentence introduction of Contact B using their bio and linking their url.
