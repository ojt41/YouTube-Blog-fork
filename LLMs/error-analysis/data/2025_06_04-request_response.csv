"5 ways to make money with your AI skills 
- get a job 
- implementation 
- strategy/consulting 
- education
- product","Let’s break down the questions before writing:

**What is the purpose of this post?**  
Educate and validate content on practical ways to monetize AI skills. Demonstrate expertise and spark discussion.

**Who is the target audience?**  
People learning or working in AI (beginners to intermediate), potential students, and AI-curious solopreneurs/freelancers.

**Wireframe:**  
- [Hook]: 5 clear ways anyone with AI skills can earn real income  
- [Meat]: Short explanation of each path: job, implementation, consulting, education, product  
- [CTA]: Ask readers which path they’re on/interested in

---

**MEAT (body):**

Here’s what I wish someone laid out clearly for me years ago—the main ways AI skills *actually* turn into income:

1. **Get a job**  
Traditional, but still the most direct for most people. Roles from data scientist to ML engineer are everywhere.

2. **Implementation (Freelancing/Contracting)**  
Jump in and help startups or businesses integrate AI—from chatbots to automation scripts.

3. **Strategy/Consulting**  
Many companies have AI FOMO but zero idea where to begin. Becoming the person who *guides* teams (not just codes) is huge.

4. **Education/Content**  
If you can teach what you’re learning, there’s massive demand—courses, workshops, YouTube, or newsletters.

5. **Build a product**  
The riskiest, but potentially most rewarding: create and sell an AI-powered product or tool (SaaS, mobile app, etc.)

No one path fits everyone, and many blend 2–3 of these at once (I do!).

**CTA:**  
Curious: Which path are you most interested in—or already on?  
Would love to hear what’s working for you (or where you’re stuck).

**HOOK (final):**

"AI principles I know at 29, I wish I had known at 24.","First, let's clarify before writing:

**Purpose:**  
Share hard-won lessons and principles about AI to help others learn faster and avoid mistakes—an educational and personal reflection post.

**Target Audience:**  
Young/early-career AI enthusiasts, aspiring AI professionals, and peers starting out, especially those who want to accelerate their learning curve in AI (students, junior devs, solopreneurs).

### The Meat (Body)

At 24, I dove into the AI world headfirst.  
At 29, here are five hard truths I wish I’d taken seriously from day one:

- **Your “perfect” model doesn’t matter if nobody uses it.**  
  Real impact comes from building things people actually need.

- **You learn 10x faster by shipping projects, not reading papers.**  
  Theory matters, but nothing teaches like getting your hands dirty.

- **Most AI breakthroughs start as simple hacks.**  
  Don’t wait on the “big idea”—start with a working prototype.

- **“Data > Model.”**  
  A mediocre model trained on good data will outperform a great model on bad data—every time.

- **Open-source is your free mentorship.**  
  Read open repo code. Contribute. The best shortcuts are in public.

If I’d known these upfront, I’d have skipped a lot of dead ends (and shipped way more cool stuff).

If you want this tweaked or focused on a certain audience, let me know!"
"Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.
They just do this one thing more… BUILD","Let’s think step by step:

**Purpose:**  
- Inspire and motivate the audience to take action (build projects in AI/tech), while demystifying “top AI engineers.”
- Subtle education: emphasizes learning by doing rather than waiting for expertise.

**Target audience:**  
- Aspiring AI engineers, students, self-taught developers, new creators feeling “not smart enough” or intimidated by the field.
- Secondary: Shaw’s wider audience of solopreneurs and technical learners.

**Wireframe:**  
[Hook]  
Most top AI engineers aren’t more intelligent than you.  
They just do this one thing more… BUILD

[Body]  
- Expands on the idea that building and experimenting is the “real” advantage  
- Personal anecdote or lesson about starting out/intimidation/learning  
- Action steps or encouragement to start building now

[CTA]  
- Prompt to share a project they’re working on, or ask about barriers to getting started

---

**Drafting the Body**

Most of the “top” AI engineers I know aren’t super-geniuses.  
They’re just relentless builders.

When I first started out, I spent months reading, coding little toy examples, waiting to feel ready to tackle a “real” project.

Spoiler: that moment never comes.

The biggest shift for me?  
Deciding to ship unfinished, imperfect projects anyway.

Building is the fastest way to learn:  
- You hit real problems (and solve them)  
- You see what matters—and what doesn’t  
- You get feedback and momentum

Every small project compounds.  
It’s not about brilliance—it’s about doing the reps.

7 LLM use cases (have helped me avoid hiring people as a solopreneur),"**Step-by-step thinking (before writing the post):**

**Purpose:**  
Educate and validate content idea—showcase practical, real ways to leverage LLMs as a solopreneur, demonstrating value (and credibility) by sharing personal experience. 

**Target audience:**  
Fellow solopreneurs, AI-curious freelancers, and tech-savvy self-starters looking to boost productivity and lower costs.

---

**Wireframe Outline:**

- **Hook:** ""7 ways LLMs replaced hires in my solopreneur journey"" or focus on the pain point: ""Hiring is expensive—here’s how LLMs saved me thousands.""
- **Body:** List 7 practical use cases, briefly describe each, emphasizing what *was* needed (a human), but what’s *now* automated by AI. Make them actionable + honest about limitations.
- **CTA:** Invite readers to share their own hacks, or ask: “How are you using LLMs to replace manual work?”

---

**Drafting the body first:**

Over the last year, I've used LLMs to tackle tasks I used to dread outsourcing (or just...never did).  
Here are 7 real use cases where language models saved me from hiring out:

1. **Content drafting:** Blog posts, newsletters, and even video outlines—they handle my first drafts, so I only step in to edit.
2. **Customer support:** Automated answers for FAQs, common troubleshooting, and even DM replies—all without hiring a VA.
3. **Simple code generation:** Quick data scripts or website tweaks—I use LLMs as a pair programmer for non-critical code.
4. **Research summaries:** Instead of sending tasks to an assistant, I prompt LLMs to scan docs, recap articles, or pull key takeaways.
5. **Proposal & invoice templates:** Clean, customizable templates generated on-demand so I don’t rewrite the same doc twice.
6. **Idea validation:** I “talk through” business or product ideas with the AI, getting rapid market/competitor snapshots before going deeper.
7. **Social post scheduling:** With a few prompts, I batch-create (and refine) a week of content, removing the need for a social media manager.

None of these are *perfect* replacements for expert human help—but for 80% of tasks, “good enough” is way better (and faster, and cheaper) than nothing at all.

---

**Drafting the CTA:**

Curious—what’s the *one* task you’ve automated with LLMs that saves you the most time?  
Or if you’re just starting, what’s your biggest bottleneck that *should* be automated?

---

**Now, drafting (and iterating) the hook:**

- ""Hiring is expensive—here are 7 ways I use LLMs so I don’t have to.""
- ""Most solopreneurs think they need a team. I replaced 7 common hires with one LLM.""
- ""If you’re a one-person business, AI can be your *whole* back office. Here’s how I do it.""
- ""7 real ways an LLM became my first (and only) 'employee.'""

Choose the one that’s concise, clear, and matches Shaw’s voice.

---

**Final Post:**

---

If you’re a one-person business, AI can be your *whole* back office.  
Here are 7 practical ways I use LLMs to skip hiring—and save thousands:

Over the last year, I’ve used language models to tackle tasks I used to dread outsourcing (or just...never did).  
Here’s what’s worked for me:

1️⃣ **Content drafting:** Blog posts, newsletters, video outlines—LLMs handle my first drafts, I just edit.  
2️⃣ **Customer support:** Automated answers for FAQs, troubleshooting, and DMs. No virtual assistant needed.  
3️⃣ **Simple code generation:** Quick data scripts or web tweaks—a pair programmer for small jobs.  
4️⃣ **Research summaries:** Prompt the LLM to summarize docs, recap articles, or highlight key points.  
5️⃣ **Proposals & invoices:** Create clean templates on demand, so I never start from scratch.  
6️⃣ **Idea validation:** Brainstorm and pressure-test new projects with the AI before diving deep.  
7️⃣ **Social post scheduling:** Batch-create a week of content in minutes, instead of hiring a social media manager.

Are these perfect? Of course not. But for 80% of “good enough” tasks, they’re faster, cheaper, and way more fun than managing a team.

2. **Choose your tools:**  
   - Python is an easy starting point.
   - Use the OpenAI API (or similar).
   - Any code editor will do (VSCode, Sublime, etc.).

3. **Install the essentials:**  
   ```
   pip install openai
   ```

4. **Write a simple script:**  
   - Give your agent a “goal” (e.g., “summarize this text file”).
   - Let the model handle the heavy lifting.

5. **Test, tweak, repeat:**  
   - Try new prompts.  
   - Play with the output.  
   - Don’t worry about it being perfect—experimentation is the whole game.

The only real “secret” is starting small and learning as you go.

My Journey from 0 to 70k (key lessons),"Let’s break this down step by step before writing the post.

---

**Step 1: What is the purpose of this post?**  
- Purpose: Share Shaw’s personal journey and key lessons learned going from $0 to $70,000 (likely as a freelancer/entrepreneur), to inspire and provide practical advice to others on a similar path.

**Step 2: Who is the target audience?**  
- Aspiring or current freelancers, solopreneurs, anyone starting out in AI or tech services, people thinking about building a business online. Possibly side hustlers or those looking to break free from salaried roles.

---

**Step 3: Wireframe the post (structure and talking points):**

1. **Hook ideas:**  
    - “My journey from $0 to $70k wasn’t what I expected.”  
    - “The 5 lessons I wish I knew before earning my first $70,000 online.”

2. **Body/meat of the post:**  
   - Concise origin story: How I started → What changed → Where I am now  
   - 3–5 specific lessons (brief bullet or paragraph each)
      - (e.g. biggest mistakes, biggest mindset shifts, unexpected learnings)
      - Framed as actionable takeaways/what I’d do differently
   - Maybe a quick note on what $70k means (context: freedom, confidence, etc.)

3. **Call to action:**  
   - Invite others to share their own lessons/ask questions  
   - Maybe offer a deeper dive if interested

**Step 4: Write the body (meat) of the post**  
(Assuming details from Shaw’s journey, adapting to general AI/freelance/solopreneurship themes—feel free to adjust/clarify!)

**[DRAFT BODY]**

Looking back, the leap from $0 to my first $70k as a solo entrepreneur was equal parts grind, luck, and slow “aha!” moments.

Here are 5 lessons I wish I’d internalized sooner:

1. **You don't need everything figured out.**  
   My first offer was rough. I iterated it dozens of times. Getting feedback—fast—mattered more than perfection.

2. **Find a niche, but don’t get trapped by it.**  
   I specialized in one AI service, but explored closely-related problems each time a client asked “Can you do X?” That’s where the best gigs (and referrals) came from.

3. **Consistency > Intensity.**  
   The weeks I made small, daily progress—reaching out to leads, sharing a quick post, building a tiny project—compounded far more than sporadic “inspiration sprints.”

4. **Raise your rates sooner than feels comfortable.**  
   Pricing is a skill. Every uncomfortable conversation built my confidence. The clients who valued my work most—stayed.

5. **Share your process openly—even before you “make it.”**  
   Posting my learnings (failures and all) attracted peers, mentors, and even a few clients who resonated with the journey.

$70k isn’t “overnight success.” But it’s proof you can go from zero to momentum faster than you think—if you keep shipping, learning, and sharing.

**Post Body (write this first):**

It still blows my mind:  
50,000 people have subscribed to my YouTube channel. 🤯

When I started sharing AI projects and tutorials, I had no idea if anyone would actually watch—let alone stick around. Sometimes I felt like I was talking to a void.

Here’s what I’ve learned after 112 videos, dozens of projects, and a ton of late-night editing sessions:
- *Clarity matters more than cleverness*. The best responses come from videos where I break things down simply.
- Progress is embarrassingly slow, until suddenly, it isn’t. My first 1,000 subs took ages. The next 10,000? Way faster.
- Vulnerability and sharing mistakes build trust. My most-watched content often starts with “Here’s what went wrong...”
- People stay for the journey, not just the tutorials. The comments from folks building their own AI projects = the best part.

Thanks to everyone who’s joined—seriously.  
If you’re interested in AI, building technical projects, or just want to see what’s next, I’d love to have you along.

**Step 3: Write the Meat of the Post**

Most people overcomplicate learning AI.

You don’t need fancy models, a huge dataset, or months of free time.

Here are 10 out of 30 AI projects you could realistically build this weekend (with just an internet connection and Python):

1. **Chatbot for FAQs** — Answer your site’s top 10 questions with GPT-3.5 and Flask.
2. **Text Summarizer** — Feed in articles, get one-paragraph TL;DRs.
3. **Resume Scanner** — Rate job resumes for relevance using embeddings.
4. **YouTube Transcript Highlighter** — Auto-pull out the best quotes from any video.

"Reminder: being rich isn’t about what’s in you bank account, but what’s in your mind… keep learning","**Step-by-step Analysis**

**1. Purpose:**  
This post is meant to inspire and motivate followers by sharing a mindset shift about wealth and lifelong learning. It’s an “educate + encourage” type of content. It isn’t promoting a product but rather reinforcing Shaw’s positioning as an education-focused entrepreneur.

**2. Audience:**  
The broad audience of LinkedIn—potential students, solopreneurs, lifelong learners, and online builders. This includes both people starting their AI/self-education journey and those looking for insight or encouragement.

**3. Wireframe:**
- Hook: Flip the script on conventional ideas about “rich.”
- Meat: Brief discussion about wealth = mindset, not money. Life-long learning as the real currency.
- CTA: Question—how do you invest in your learning?

---

**Drafting the Post (meat first):**

A number in your bank account doesn’t define your wealth.  
What actually sets you apart?  
The skills you build and the knowledge you invest in—those are assets nobody can tax, steal, or deflate.

In tech (and life), everything changes so fast. What you know, what you can do, and *how quickly you can learn* are worth more than any paycheck.

I’ve learned (the hard way) that prioritizing learning *always* pays off—sometimes not immediately, but always in the long run.  

Books, courses, projects, conversations with smart people—these are the best “investments” I’ve made.

---

**CTA:**

What’s one way you’ve invested in your own learning lately?  
Drop a resource or habit in the comments—I’m always looking to learn from this community.

---

**Now, the Hook:**

Feeling “rich” isn’t about your bank account—it’s about your mindset.  
The wealthiest people I know are always learning.

A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people. Share 3 types of software.,"**Step-by-step: Define Purpose and Audience**

- **Purpose:** Educate. The goal is to clarify the ambiguity around “AI” by showcasing 3 distinct types of AI software, helping readers orient themselves in the AI landscape.
- **Target Audience:** Broad – professionals, beginners, and entrepreneurs interested in AI, many of whom are confused by the buzzword and looking for clarity.

---

**Wireframe**

- Hook: AI means something different to almost everyone you meet—but here’s a simple way to break it down.
- Meat: Briefly define 3 types of “AI” software with examples and why the distinction matters.
- CTA: Ask how others define AI or what other types they’d add.

---

**The Meat of the Post (Body)**

The term “AI” gets thrown around so much that it starts to lose all meaning.

Here’s my simple breakdown:  
**1. Predictive AI:**  
- *What it does:* Analyzes data to predict outcomes (e.g., will a customer click, will this part break).  
- *Everyday example:* Netflix recommending what you’ll watch next.

**2. Generative AI:**  
- *What it does:* Creates new content—text, images, code, audio—from prompts or data.  
- *Everyday example:* ChatGPT writing an email, Midjourney generating an image.

**3. Autonomous Agents:**  
- *What it does:* Takes actions in the real world or digital spaces to achieve goals, often making decisions along the way.  
- *Everyday example:* A bot that schedules meetings for you, or runs customer support chat on your website.

Why does this matter?  
When you’re building (or buying) “AI,” knowing which type you need shapes everything—from the tools you pick to how you measure success.

---

**CTA / Engagement**

How do YOU define “AI” in your work?  
Are there other types of AI tools you use that don’t fit these buckets?

---

**Now, The Hook**

“Ask 10 people what ‘AI’ means—you’ll get 10 different answers.”

---

**Final Post — Shaw Talebi Style**

---

Ask 10 people what “AI” means—you’ll get 10 different answers.

The term gets thrown around so much that it’s lost all meaning.  
So here’s my simple breakdown:

**1. Predictive AI:**  
➔ Analyzes data to predict what’s likely to happen  
_E.g.: Netflix recommending what you’ll watch next._

**2. Generative AI:**  
➔ Creates brand new content from prompts or data  
_E.g.: ChatGPT writing an email, Midjourney making an image._

**3. Autonomous Agents:**  
➔ Takes actions to accomplish goals, often making decisions for you  
_E.g.: A bot that books meetings or runs your support chat._

Why does this matter?  
When you’re building (or buying) “AI,” knowing the type shapes everything—from the tech you choose to the results you expect.

How do YOU define “AI” in your work? Are there other kinds of AI tools you’d add to the list?"

"3 communication tips for data scientists.
use stories
Use examples
Use analogies","**Before Writing**

**Purpose:**  
Educate (share practical advice to help data scientists communicate complex ideas more clearly).

**Hook:**
Most brilliant data science work gets ignored for one reason...

**Meat:**  
You can build the best AI model in the world—but if you can’t explain it, you’ll get overlooked, misunderstood, or stuck re-explaining yourself for the tenth time.

Here are 3 ways I’ve learned to bridge that gap:

1. **Stories** – Put your work into context. Tell a quick story—why did this problem matter? What changed because of your project?

2. **Examples** – Walk through simple, real-world scenarios. “Imagine you’re a customer who...” is often more helpful than any equation.

3. **Analogies** – Compare your concepts to familiar ideas from daily life. “Think of our neural net like a team of chefs, each handling a specific ingredient...” It might sound silly, but it sticks.

If you want to influence decisions (and not just dashboards), focus as much on *how* you communicate as *what* you create.

**Draft LinkedIn Post:**

How I’d Start Learning AI in 2025 (If I Had To Begin From Zero)  

Most “learn AI” guides are either:  
a) Way too academic  
b) All theory, no doing  
c) Focused on “getting a job,” not actually building

Here’s how I’d actually do it, step by step:

**1. Use ChatGPT (or similar) every day**
- Don’t just read about AI. Play with it!  
- Treat it as your study partner, code buddy, and explainer.  
- Even basic daily use builds intuition about what’s possible.

**2. Install Python**  
- Most AI tools and projects are built in Python.  
- Don’t worry about being an expert—just get comfortable running scripts.  
- Pro tip: Use VS Code or Google Colab to make life easier.

**3. Build a Simple Automation (Beginner Level)**  
- Example: Automate renaming files, sending emails, scraping a website, or summarizing a PDF.  
- This gets you using APIs and writing code that saves you time.

**4. Build a Minimal ML Project (Intermediate)**  
- Example: Train a basic spam filter, a sentiment detector, or image classifier.  
- Use tutorials, Kaggle datasets, and HuggingFace models—you don’t need to invent anything new.

**5. Build a Real-World Project (Advanced)**  
- Solve an actual problem you care about (personal or at work).  
- Example: AI assistant for your job, custom chatbot for your family, automate workflow for your side hustle.

Why?  
Because the fastest way to learn is to build.  
Don’t wait for a formal class or certificate—just start shipping small things and learn as you go.  
You’ll build confidence *and* a portfolio that actually impresses.

What step are you on—or would you add something to this list?  
👇 Let me know if you want examples or resources for any stage.

Booked my most expensive mentorship call yet—$700/hr.  
Here are 3 takeaways from the experience:  

1. **Value > Time**  
The client wasn’t paying for an hour—they were paying for months (even years) of distilled experience and immediate feedback on a make-or-break problem.

2. **Clarity Wins**  
Before the call, I sent a direct “here’s what you’ll get” note. That crystal-clear outcome was why they booked without hesitation.

3. **Imposter Syndrome Never Leaves (But That’s OK)**  
Yes—I hesitated to name my price. But experience and testimonials do add up. If you’re reading this and feeling “not ready,” you might be further along than you think.

Breaking down my first $10k month (as an entrepreneur). Revenue sources and breakdown,"Let’s go step by step:

**Purpose of this post:**  
- Share a milestone (transparency, motivation)
- Educate fellow entrepreneurs/solopreneurs on revenue streams/mix
- Build trust through detailed numbers and lessons (authenticity)
- Subtly promote Shaw’s expertise

**Target Audience:**  
- Early-stage solopreneurs, freelancers, indie hackers
- Aspiring creators, people interested in AI/tech business models
- Followers interested in Shaw’s entrepreneurial journey

**Wireframe:**
- Hook: Milestone or “here’s what most people don’t see…”
- Body: Candid revenue breakdown, sources, % if helpful, what surprised, what underperformed, key lessons  
- CTA: Prompt for discussion (“What’s your main revenue source right now?”, “Curious how others diversify”, etc.)

---

**Writing the body:**

Last month, I hit my first $10k month as an entrepreneur.

Here’s exactly where that income came from (no fluff):

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- **AI Course Sales:** $5,200 (my main engine right now)
- **Freelance AI Projects:** $2,900 (2 clients, mostly consulting + prototype builds)
- **YouTube Ad Revenue:** $1,100 (finally monetized, honestly lower than expected)
- **Affiliate/Tool Referrals:** $800 (not passive, takes real effort)

**What surprised me:**
- Course sales still drive the majority, but client work is a close second (and more stable than I expected).
- YouTube income is *not* passive magic—in my niche, it takes a real audience.
- Referrals only work when you actually use/review the tools you recommend.

**Big lesson:**  
Diversification isn’t just a buzzword—it keeps you afloat when one stream is slow.  
But focus matters too: depth > breadth, or everything suffers.

**CTA:**  
What’s your primary revenue source right now?  
Are you focusing on growing one, or stacking multiple streams?

Managing technical debt when coding with AI. Being mindful of speed-debt tradeoff.,"**Step-by-step prep before writing:**

**1. What is the purpose of this post?**  
Educate technical peers and AI builders about managing technical debt in the context of AI-powered coding, highlighting the common speed-vs-quality tradeoff.

**2. Who is the target audience?**  
Primarily engineers, indie hackers, solopreneurs, and technical founders who use AI (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) to code faster, but might overlook long-term code health.

---

**Wireframe:**

**Hook:**  
Are you trading future headaches for today’s speed with AI-powered coding?

**Body:**  
The biggest advantage of using AI for code isn’t just speed—it’s iteration velocity.

But there’s a hidden cost: technical debt stacks up *fast* if you’re not careful.

Every shortcut you (or your AI) takes can become tomorrow’s maintenance nightmare:
- Suggestions that “just about work”
- Haphazard file structures
- Repeated logic copied all over

AI tools make it tempting to skip docs, ignore edge cases, and pile on TODOs.  
The result? Fragile code that slows you down long-term.

My rule-of-thumb:  
It’s fine to move fast with AI—*as long as you’re conscious about what debt you’re taking on and put boundaries in place*.

What helps:  
- Set a debt limit (e.g., “Refactor after every 5 features shipped”)
- Use AI to write tests, not just features
- Keep a running “debt log” for future clean-up

Don’t let “AI speed” turn into “AI mess.”  
If you make debt explicit, you control it instead of the other way around.

How do you manage the speed vs. debt tradeoff when coding with AI? Any strategies or hard lessons learned?

**Body:**

Many AI projects get stuck because they only handle one type of data—usually just text.

But the real world is messy: images, audio, documents, even code, all tangled together.

If you want to build more powerful, practical AI systems, you need to go multimodal.

Here are 3 practical ways to make your LLMs multimodal:

1. **LLM + Tools:**  
   Let the language model call APIs that can process images, audio, or other data types (think: sending an image to an OCR service). You control the workflow—LLMs orchestrate, tools do the heavy lifting.

2. **LLM + Adapters:**  
   Plug in adapters that convert non-text data (like images or speech) into embeddings the LLM understands. This way, your LLM can “see” or “hear” even if it was only trained on text.

3. **Unified Models:**  
   Train or fine-tune large models on multiple modalities from the start (like GPT-4 vision). These models can understand and generate across text, images, and more—no glue code required.

I just broke down each approach (with code snippets + use cases) in my latest blog post.

**1. Write the meat/body:**  

I spent last weekend fine-tuning FLUX.1—my favorite image generation model—on a dataset of…my own face.

The process was surprisingly straightforward:
- Gather photos (turns out, selfies are good for science)
- Prep the data and tweak the hyperparameters
- Wait nervously while the model “learns” me

Why do this? Besides the obvious fun factor, it’s a great way to understand hands-on model customization and see where these tools shine (and where they glitch).

A few things I learned:
- Even small datasets can capture personal features impressively well
- The most interesting results come from *weird* prompts—get creative!
- The biggest bottleneck? Cleaning the data, not the model itself

I wrote up the full experiment, with code and results, here:

What happens when you fine-tune an AI model… on your own face? 🤔

I spent last weekend fine-tuning FLUX.1—my favorite image generation model—on a dataset of…my own face.

The workflow:
- Gather a batch of selfies (awkward, but necessary)
- Prep & clean the dataset (the bottleneck!)
- Adjust the model and hit “go”

Why do this? Besides the obvious fun factor, it’s the fastest way to get hands-on with model customization, and see where these tools really shine (or break).

3 Takeaways:
- Even a tiny dataset can clone personal features (sometimes *too* well)
- The wildest results come from unusual creative prompts—don’t be afraid to experiment
- Most of the headache is in data prep, not fancy modeling

I broke down the whole process, shared the best (and worst) output images, and included setup notes here:

Share blog: multimodal embeddings,"**First, let’s clarify:**

- **Purpose:** Share and drive traffic to Shaw’s new blog post on *multimodal embeddings*. Likely objective: educate and share useful thinking; potentially validate the topic’s interest level too.
- **Audience:** Technical/AI-curious audience (fellow entrepreneurs, engineers, technical founders, advanced builders)—those interested in practical applications or cutting-edge AI.

---

### Wireframe

**Body:**  
- Brief, plain English explainer: what are *multimodal embeddings* and why should you care?
- (Optional) 1-2 practical examples/applications.
- Mention the new blog post for deeper dive.
- CTA inviting discussion (Have you used these? What’s tricky/confusing?).

**CTA:**  
What use cases are you building or curious about?  
Or: Drop your own questions if you hit speed bumps building with multimodal models!

**Hook:**  
- “Ever wonder how AI can connect text, images, and audio into a single understanding?”  
- Or: “Every new AI product wants to be ‘multimodal’—but how does that work, under the hood?”

---

## Draft

---

**[HOOK — place above the fold]**  
Every AI product wants to be “multimodal.”  
But does *anyone* explain how these systems actually represent everything—text, images, even audio—so a model “understands” them together?

---

**[BODY]**

The secret: *multimodal embeddings.*

Instead of treating each input (words, pixels, sound waves) as a totally separate language, new models map them all into a single shared space—a mathematical “playground” where relationships between a photo, a caption, and an audio clip actually make sense to the AI.

Why does this matter?
- Search: Find the right image using a text prompt, or vice versa
- Context-aware AI: Your app can “see” what you upload and “read” your description at the same time
- Next-gen creation: Generate images from text, remix audio from visual cues, build smarter interfaces

But the magic (and complexity) is in how you build and *use* these universal representations.  
I just published a beginner-friendly breakdown with examples—no PhD required.

### Body (Meat) of the Post

I left my comfortable job thinking I’d build something great quickly.

Instead, I spent 15 months trying—and failing—to get traction.

What those months *really* looked like:
- Projects no one wanted
- Lonely hours second-guessing myself
- Days where “progress” meant not giving up

But every failure forced me to get clearer:
- On who I help (niching down was a game-changer)
- Which skills clients *actually* pay for
- How to price myself (hint: charging more attracts better work)

At month 16, I crossed my first $10k month—not because I “hacked growth,” but because I got relentless about understanding real client needs and stopped chasing shiny objects.

The struggle wasn’t wasted—it forced me to build *systems*, not just wish for luck.

"Share blog: How to Deploy ML Solutions with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP","**Step-by-step planning:**

**1. What is the purpose of this post?**  
- The main purpose is to promote/share a new technical blog post (“How to Deploy ML Solutions with FastAPI, Docker, and GCP”).  
- Secondary purpose: Educate and show practical deployment workflows, signal expertise.

**2. Who is the target audience?**  
- Technical practitioners: Data scientists, ML engineers, technical founders, indie hackers, and devs looking to productionize ML projects.
- May also be useful for students and “AI builders” looking to move beyond notebooks to real-world deployment.

**Wireframe:**

**Hook:**  
[Needs to call out the pain or challenge: Many data people struggle to deploy ML, or tease the simplicity of the process with the right stack.]

**Meat:**  
- Briefly explain the need/pain: “You’ve built a model. Now what?” Most ML projects never get deployed.
- That’s why a simple, repeatable stack (FastAPI + Docker + GCP) matters: productionize your work, share it with the world, and actually deliver value.
- Short summary of what’s in the guide: step-by-step, real code, common pitfalls.
- Mention that it’s not theory—this is practical and get-it-done.
- (Optional) Share a personal angle or lesson, e.g., “This is the exact process I use on my own projects.”

**CTA:**  
- “If this sounds useful, check out the blog (link in the first comment)”
- Or: “Curious: what stacks or clouds are you using for ML deploys right now?”

**Hook:**

- Option 2: “Built a great ML model? Now get it in the hands of real users.”  
- Option 3: “90% of ML projects never escape the notebook. Here’s how to ship yours—step by step.”

---

**Draft the body first:**

Most ML projects never make it past the prototype phase.  
You train a model, tweak hyperparameters… then the code gathers dust.

The real world needs *productionized* solutions. Deploying with the right stack—FastAPI for quick APIs, Docker for real-world portability, and GCP for scalable hosting—makes all the difference.

I put together a hands-on guide:
- Packaging your model with FastAPI (Python)
- Wrapping it in Docker so “it works on your machine” works everywhere
- Deploying to Google Cloud, step by step
- Real code & pitfalls I’ve hit (and how to fix them)

No hand-waving theory—just a simple, practical workflow you can reuse for your own projects.

Birthday post. Past year recap by the numbers.,"Let’s first clarify:

**Purpose:**  
Share a personal milestone to humanize Shaw, recap concrete achievements (“by the numbers”), and quietly reinforce expertise—while inviting engagement and reflection.

**Meat of the post:**

Another year around the sun—which means time for my annual “by the numbers” recap.

I started this tradition to stay honest with myself and with all of you. Here’s what stood out between the last birthday and today:

• 👨‍💻 3 AI projects shipped (including my first agent that actually solved *my* problem)
• 🎥 42 pieces of educational content published, across 2 platforms
• 💸 $XX,XXX earned from consulting & teaching (my highest annual so far)
• 👥 2,100 new people joined my learning community (welcome!)
• ⏳ ~43 experiments that failed, fizzled, or never even launched (fun fact: those taught me the most)

Biggest lesson: consistent progress > big launches. Most things didn’t “go viral”—they just quietly worked, a little better every month.

**What wasn’t in the plan:**  
I certainly didn’t forecast [briefly name surprise challenge or change—“moving countries,” “failing at X,” or “burning out for a month”]. Grateful for friends and collaborators who kept me moving forward.

**CTA:**

If you’ve survived another year building/learning/growing, I’d love to hear:  
What’s your own favorite “stat” or lesson for the past 12 months?

Or, if you’re reading this and feeling stuck: start your own “by the numbers” list, even if it’s small. (Mine started with ‘1 YouTube video, 3 people viewed it—including my mom.’)

Now, generating the LinkedIn post in Shaw's voice:

---

**YouTube just hit 60,000 subscribers.**

Honestly? The number itself isn’t what excites me.

What matters is what those 60k represent:  
- 60,000 people who’ve decided learning about AI and tech is worth their time  
- 60,000 chances for a single lesson to spark a new project or idea  
- And 60,000 opportunities for me to practice something I care about deeply: turning complex problems into clear, actionable steps

I started the channel to get better at explaining what I learned—mostly for myself, at first.  
Now, it’s grown into a place where real conversations happen about AI, tools, and actually *using* this stuff to build or freelance.

The most surprising lesson?  
Learning in public is the best feedback loop I’ve ever found.  
Every video, DM, and comment teaches me something new—about what works, what doesn’t, and how to communicate better.

Thank you for being part of this. If you’re learning or building online too, I’d love to hear:  
What’s been YOUR biggest lesson on the journey so far?

**Body of the Post:**

When I started as a data entrepreneur, I thought technical chops were enough.

I was wrong.

Here are 10 non-technical skills I *had* to learn to survive (and later thrive):

1. **Explaining technical ideas simply**  
   If your grandma can’t get it, your customer won’t buy it.

2. **Talking to customers**  
   Not just talking—actually *listening* for the real pain points.

3. **Turning business needs into solvable problems**  
   The code is the last step. The first? A clear business question.

4. **Asking great questions**  
   “What would success look like?” will tell you more than a dashboard ever could.

5. **Validating product/service ideas**  
   Do people care about this enough to pay? I learned how to ask without bias.

6. **Fast, respectful email replies**  
   Responsiveness = trust, especially in the early days.

7. **Sales**  
   Yes—you need to SELL, whether you’re ready or not.

8. **Warm outreach**  
   Not spamming, not lurking. How to introduce yourself and your offer so people *actually* respond.

9. **Building landing pages**  
   Technical is one thing, but can you create a page that *converts*?

10. **Writing compelling copy**  
    Turns out: “just the facts” doesn’t persuade anyone. (Still practicing this one!)

None of these came naturally to me, but they made all the difference.

   Not spamming, not lurking. How to introduce yourself and your offer so people *actually* respond.
9. **Building landing pages**  
   Technical is one thing, but can you create a page that *converts*?
10. **Writing compelling copy**  
    Turns out: “just the facts” doesn’t persuade anyone. (Still practicing this one!)

None of these came naturally to me, but they made all the difference.

**Meat of the Post:**

When I left the safety of a paycheck to become a (data) entrepreneur, I assumed coding and “using AI” would be enough.

Reality: it took 10+ other skills I hadn’t planned for.

Here were the most important ones—many I learned the hard way:
- Spotting real pain points (not just building cool tech)
- Writing (and rewriting) everything: proposals, posts, docs
- Actually talking to clients (harder than it sounds)
- Selling—without feeling like a spammer
- Sharing wins and failures online (scary at first, worth it)
- Cold outbound (DMs, emails, LinkedIn), even when it feels awkward
- Building a decent website in a weekend
- Making quick content, not waiting for “perfect”
- Looking foolish (often)
- Using AI tools efficiently—real productivity, not just “playing”
- Constant learning (the only permanent skill)

Some of these aren’t glamorous, but every single one mattered.

$1500 side hustles for data scientists and MLEs,"**Step-by-Step Thought Process:**

1. **What is the purpose of this post?**  
   - Educate and inspire data scientists and ML engineers about actionable side hustles that can net ~$1500/month.
   - Possibly validate deeper content (newsletter, course, etc.) on this topic for Shaw’s audience.

2. **Who is the target audience?**  
   - Data scientists and ML engineers (MLEs), probably mid-level+, looking for extra income, autonomy, or to dip their toes into freelancing/solopreneurship.

3. **Wireframe:**  
   - Hook: Attention-grabber challenging beliefs/validating curiosity about realistic, technical side hustles for ML pros
   - Body: List-style breakdown of several $1500 ideas w/ short actionable notes (maybe a personal insight or two)
   - CTA: Ask for additions or experiences, option to tease a link/deeper content

---

### Step 2: Write the Body (meat)

If you’re a data scientist or MLE, you already have rare skills most companies *wish* they could hire—even for small, project-based help.

Here are 5 $1500/month side hustles I’ve seen real ML folks start (and yes, this is before the “quit your job” phase):

**1. Build micro-automations for SMBs**
- Small businesses are drowning in spreadsheets, repetitive reporting, and manual “clean up.”  
- Offer to automate reporting, forecasting, or data cleaning for $500-$2000 per project (yes, many will pay).

**2. ML model evaluations on Upwork/Freelance platforms**
- Many startups and teams want a second opinion on their models.  
- Quick audits, error analysis, and performance reviews can turn around $500–$2k, often async.

**3. Online course or technical workshop**
- Package a lesson you already know well—(e.g. a custom Pandas workflow, productionizing an ML API, etc.)  
- Sell via Gumroad or run a live Zoom. A well-marketed ~3-hour workshop can earn $1k+ a pop.

**4. Tune open-source models for niche applications**
- Take an open-source model + a small domain’s dataset (think: property listings, local news, custom Slack bots).  
- Offer a “fine-tuned, ready-to-use” model to companies for a flat fee.

**5. Technical ghostwriting or “thought leadership” for founders**
- Many founders *want* to write smart AI/ML articles for their LinkedIn/newsletters, but never do.  
- If you can explain complex things simply, businesses pay $200–$500/post (or much more with a retainer).

You don’t need 100k followers or a big client list—just pick one problem you can solve for someone with less time or know-how than you.

"My $15,000 AI content creation strategy","**Step 1: Clarify Purpose & Audience**

- **Purpose:** The $15,000 figure suggests this is about sharing a monetized strategy, so likely a mix of education, content validation, and establishing credibility—possibly to attract followers, students, or consulting leads.
- **Audience:** Likely aspiring AI creators, freelancers, solopreneurs, and LinkedIn followers interested in making money with AI/content. Also peers and those considering Shaw’s courses or advice.

---

**Wireframe**

- **Hook:** Reference the $15k figure, tease practical steps/results, and make it personal. (Save this for last)
- **Meat:** Lay out the strategy—tools, process, maybe numbers, lessons learned, mistakes, and what’s replicable for others.
- **CTA:** Prompt readers to share their approach, ask for questions, or invite them to follow/engage.

---

**Body (Meat of the Post):**

Last year, I set out to prove that you can turn AI-powered content creation into real revenue—without a team, without burning out, and without “hustle culture.”

Here’s the (very repeatable) strategy I used to hit $15,000 in revenue:

**1. Niche down — hard.**  
I focused on tactical AI walkthroughs for freelancers and solo founders—not generic news or hype.

**2. Build an evergreen “engine”.**  
Every piece of content served *two* roles:  
- Quick 1-minute breakdowns on LinkedIn  
- In-depth, SEO-optimized tutorials on my Notion and YouTube

**3. Use AI for 80%—polish the rest.**  
I let GPT-4 and Claude draft outlines, repurpose transcripts, and even create visuals. My job? Personalize, edit, and inject real case studies.

**4. Monetize multiple ways.**  
- Direct: PDF guides and Notion templates ($15-$99 each, sold via Gumroad/Notion)  
- Indirect: Consulting leads, email partnerships

**5. Keep it painfully simple.**  
All I needed:  
- ChatGPT Plus  
- Canva  
- Notion  
- Loom (for quick video)  
And a few automations (Zapier, Make) to turn content into products.

**Worst mistake?**

"5 Tips for Building AI systems That Are Useless and Forgotten
Spend no time on data curation
Assume your data quality is good (without looking)
Only train one version of your model
Focus more on using new tech over the business problem
Don’t worry about evals until ready to push to prod
","Let’s think step by step.

**1. Purpose of this post:**  
The goal is to educate (through a tongue-in-cheek, “what NOT to do” list) about common mistakes in AI projects that lead to failed, forgotten, or useless systems. It showcases Shaw’s technical expertise, teaching style, and ability to break down best practices by highlighting pitfalls.

**2. Target audience:**  
Primary: engineers, technical founders, and fellow AI builders—anyone working on or leading AI system development.  
Secondary: business folks dabbling in AI, product managers, or aspiring ML practitioners.

## Step 1: Wireframe

**Hook**:  
(A sharp, cheeky statement or question teasing “how to guarantee your AI project fails”)

**Body:**  
- List the 5 “tips” (framing them as bad advice—light sarcasm)
- Brief commentary on why each one is a real problem, and how to avoid it

**CTA:**  
Ask audience: “What’s the most common AI project mistake you’ve seen?” or “Which of these have you seen in the wild?”

---

## Step 2: Body

Let’s go:

Here are 5 bulletproof ways to make sure your AI system is ignored, forgotten, or useless:

1. **Skip data curation entirely.**  
   Why bother? Just point your model at everything you have—duplicates, noise, and all.

2. **Assume your data quality is great (without checking).**  
   Looking for missing values or incorrect labels is overrated… right? Just trust it.

3. **Only train one version of your model.**  
   Who needs iterations? The first run is always perfect the first time.

4. **Chase the shiny tech over the business problem.**  
   Because having the *latest* model matters more than delivering real value.

5. **Save evaluation for after you’re ready for production.**  
   What could possibly go wrong if you skip evals until go-live?

Having built—and seen—my share of failed AI projects, all of these are easier (and more common) than you might think.

The cure? Flip each one:  
- Invest in data curation  
- Make data quality checks a habit  
- Iterate relentlessly  
- Keep business value front and center  
- Start evaluations early and often

2. **Assume your data quality is great (without checking).**  
   Missing values? Incorrect labels? No big deal—just trust it blindly.

3. **Only train one version of your model.**

Story of top ai leader at big consulting firm booking me for AI coaching,"**Step-by-step thinking:**

1. **Purpose of the post:**  
   - Show credibility by sharing a “social proof” story: a top AI leader at a major consulting firm booked Shaw for AI coaching.  
   - Subtly promote Shaw’s unique expertise that attracts established industry leaders (not just beginners).
   - Inspire/encourage others (peers, aspiring consultants, etc.) by breaking down why this happens—perhaps pointing to the importance of being practical/clear versus just chasing big credentials.

2. **Target audience:**  
   - Fellow AI educators, freelance consultants, and people interested in AI upskilling (either for themselves or for clients).
   - Ambitious professionals who might feel “not expert enough” to teach or coach.

**Body of the Post:**

A few weeks ago, I got an email that honestly made my day:

A top AI leader at one of the world’s biggest consulting firms was reaching out—not to pitch me on a job, but to *book me* for a private AI coaching session.

Here’s what surprised me:  
They’ve got a massive team, a bookshelf of credentials, and way more “big name” experience than me.

So why me?

Turns out, what they were hungry for wasn’t a credentials arms race. It was practical, current advice. Honest feedback—no jargon or fluff. Someone who’d tested the latest AI tools hands-on and could cut through the noise.

This is something I see over and over:
- The people at the top aren’t looking for more theory
- They want real talk, rapid iteration, clear next steps

If you've ever thought:  
“Who am I to teach/coach/consult in AI, with so many experts out there?”  
—remember, what’s *obvious* to you is *gold* to someone who’s buried in the hype.

If you’re willing to learn in public, share what actually works, and be real about what doesn’t—you’ll be amazed who reaches out.

Ever worried about sending private docs to the cloud just to get AI answers?  
You’re not alone—I get this question nearly every week.

Here’s a project that solves it:
**A local Question-Answering (QA) bot for your documents—zero cloud, max privacy.  
Built with Ollama (runs open LLMs locally) + Gradio (simple web UI).**

**Here’s how you’d build it:**

1. **Load your model locally** (e.g., Llama3 via Ollama)
2. **Ingest your docs** (PDFs, txts—load and split into chunks)
3. **Embed and index** them (e.g., [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/), [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss))
4. **Search and retrieve** docs based on your question
5. **Feed context to LLM**, get back an answer
6. **Create a quick UI** with Gradio

**Pseudocode (simplified):**
```python
# Step 1: Load LLM via Ollama API
llm = Ollama(model='llama3')

# Step 2: Load and split your PDFs
docs = load_and_split_pdfs('path/to/docs')

# Step 3: Embed and index
embeddings = SentenceTransformer('model-name')
index = FAISS(embeddings)
index.add(docs)

# Step 4: Gradio interface
def qa_bot(user_query):
    relevant_chunks = index.search(user_query)
    answer = llm(prompt_with_context(user_query, relevant_chunks))
    return answer

gr.Interface(qa_bot, ""text"", ""text"").launch()
```

**Helpful resources:**  
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (run LLMs locally)  
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) (easy web UI)  
- [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) + [FAISS vs Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) (vector DBs)  
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) (optional: glue code)

**Tired of uploading private documents just to get AI answers?  
There’s a better (local) way to build your own QA bot—in an afternoon.**

Ever since local LLMs hit mainstream, I get the same question every week:  
“How can I use AI to search my docs without sending them to the cloud?”

Here’s my go-to project for max privacy:
**A local document Q&A bot. Runs fully offline using Ollama and Gradio.**

**How to build it (in plain steps):**
1. **Load a local model** (Ollama + e.g. Llama3)
2. **Ingest and split your files** (PDF/txt)
3. **Embed and index** (SentenceTransformers + FAISS or Chroma)
4. **Grab relevant chunks** for any question
5. **Send context to LLM, get an answer**
6. **Wrap it with a fast Gradio UI**

Here’s a skeleton in code:
```python
llm = Ollama(model='llama3')
docs = load_and_split_pdfs('path/to/docs')
embeddings = SentenceTransformer('model-name')
index = FAISS(embeddings)
index.add(docs)

def qa_bot(q):
    context = index.search(q)
    return llm(prompt_with_context(q, context))

gr.Interface(qa_bot, ""text"", ""text"").launch()

## Drafting the Body (“Meat”):

I made a big mistake: for months, I chased AI consulting projects—when my real goal was to create my own products.

Consulting is great for cash flow, but I found myself reacting to others’ problems instead of solving the ones I actually cared about. Worse, client work left little time (or energy) to build and ship my own ideas.

I finally realized: if I want to build something meaningful, I need to be talking *directly* to the people I want to help—and rapidly prototyping around their (real) needs, not just what pays next month’s bills.

So here’s my new playbook:
1. **Offer free AI consultations** to my ideal target customers
2. Turn their questions and problems into public content (win-win for learning)
3. Book more calls through that content
4. Quickly build small prototypes based on patterns I see
5. Get fast feedback from actual users
6. Repeat the cycle—tune the product, community, and learning as I go

It’s messy, but it feels way more aligned. The feedback loop is tight, and every week brings me closer to a product that solves something real.

If you want genuinely helpful AI advice *and* a say in shaping new tools, I’m booking a handful of free sessions right now. DM me or drop a “👋” below.

### Body (“Meat”) of the Post

It took me years to realize my resume was full of silent killers—things I thought would help, but actually held me back.

Here are 5 resume myths I believed (and what finally got me hired):

1. **“More pages = more impressive.”**  
   Reality: No one reads a 3-page resume. Edit ruthlessly. One page forces clarity.

2. **“List EVERYTHING you’ve ever done.”**  
   I used to cram in old jobs and irrelevant skills. Instead, tailor every bullet point to the job you want.

3. **“Fancy formatting gets noticed.”**  
   Design won’t save weak content. Substance > style. Clear, readable, and keyword-optimized always wins.

4. **“Education > Experience.”**  
   I thought my degrees were the main event. Truth is, real projects and results get interviews.

5. **“Generic summaries are safe.”**  
   Bland intros (“Hard-working professional...”) sound like everyone else. Lead with your unique wins.

Every “rule” I’d heard just kept my real skills buried—and my phone silent.

Once I ignored these myths, doors opened.

• 3 LLM use cases (that are not a chatbot) ◦ But how do I actually use ai—3 real world use cases ◦ Lead scoring ◦ Lead (unsupervised) clustering. Customer segmentation ◦ LI post writer (FT an LLM to write LI posts) ◦ LI post scoring ◦ Concept math?,"Let’s break down the user’s notes and follow the outlined process:

---

**Step 1: Analyze Purpose and Target Audience**

- **Purpose:**  
  Educate and inspire—break common misconception that LLMs are just for chatbots. Show 3 actionable, real-world use cases.
- **Target audience:**  
  AI-curious entrepreneurs, freelancers, builders—people who want to use AI practically, not just as a novelty.

---

**Step 2: Wireframe**

1. **Hook:**  
   Challenge the “AI = chatbot” narrative, tease actionable ideas.

2. **Body:**  
   - Brief opening debunking LLM = chatbot.
   - 3 specific, real-life use cases, each briefly explained:
     - Lead scoring
     - Customer segmentation (lead clustering)
     - LinkedIn post writer or scorer (could blend or pick one for clarity)
   - Mini-example or tip with each point
   - Optional: Ask if people want a “how-to” in comments

3. **CTA:**  
   - Invite other non-chatbot use cases.
   - Ask which idea resonated most or what they’d add.

---

**Step 3: Draft the Body First**

---

Most folks think “LLM = chatbot.”  
But here’s the reality: Large Language Models are versatile *building blocks* for way more than conversation.

Here are 3 practical ways to use LLMs—no chat input required:

**1. Automated Lead Scoring**  
Let the LLM analyze cold emails, website signups, or LinkedIn profiles—then give each lead a score for fit or intent.  
No more sifting through endless lists. Just sort by the best.

**2. Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Clustering)**  
Feed your customer data (like bios, job titles, pain points) into an LLM to group similar leads automatically.  
Quickly spot high-potential segments—without manually tagging or expensive tools.

**3. LinkedIn Post Generation or Scoring**  
Fine-tune an LLM on your top performing posts—then use it to write or *predict* which new drafts will resonate.  
Save hours brainstorming content. (I use this myself!)

The bottom line:  
LLMs are *tools,* not just talkers. What else could you automate or enhance with them?

What is data quality? Accuracy and diversity.,"Let's step through it:

**Purpose:**  
Educate—clarify the concept of ""data quality"" in the context of AI (likely validating content for a lesson or post).

**Target Audience:**  
People learning or working with AI—potential students, early practitioners, or fellow solopreneurs trying to get better results from machine learning/automation.

---

**WIRE FRAME**

**Hook:**  
Why “data quality” beats “data quantity” every time in AI.

**Meat:**  
When people talk about building better AI models, the first thing they focus on is *how much* data they have.

But the *real* game-changer?  
It's not about *more* data, but *better* data.

What does “better” mean here?  
Two essentials:
- **Accuracy**: Is your data correct, current, and trustworthy? If your labels are wrong, your model will be too.
- **Diversity**: Does your data represent all the situations your model will face in the real world? Edge cases, rare examples, and different perspectives reduce bias and improve results.

Even with fancy algorithms, you can't paper over poor-quality data.  
So before you upgrade your hardware, ask:  
Is my data accurate? Is it diverse enough?

**CTA:**  
How do you check—or improve—data quality in your own projects?  
Would love to hear your tips and tools 👇

---

**HOOK OPTIONS** (choose best):
- Most people chase *more* data. But ask any experienced AI builder: Quality rules over quantity—every time.
- 99% of AI projects fail quietly—because the data quality isn’t there.
- Want better AI results? Start with these 2 questions about your data.

**FINAL POST:**

---

Most people chase *more* data. But ask any experienced AI builder: Quality rules over quantity—every time.

When you hear “build a great AI model,” it’s tempting to think about sheer size—more samples, more labels, more everything.

But quantity doesn’t help if your data isn’t:
- **Accurate** (are your labels and facts correct?)
- **Diverse** (does it cover all the real-world situations your AI will need to handle?)

Without those, even the best models fall short.

So here’s my go-to gut check before starting any project:
1. Is my data accurate?
2. Is it diverse enough?

How do *you* improve (or measure) data quality on your projects?

# Post Wireframe

**[Hook]**  
A big, relatable problem for freelancers (keeping tabs on jobs, missed opportunities, juggling applications).  
Tease the solution: “Here’s a dashboard I built for Upwork.”

**[Meat/Body]**  
- Quick intro: Why tracking Upwork jobs is hard/painful  
- What this dashboard does—real benefits/use cases  
- Brief details about how it works (tech/tools, e.g., scraping, API, notifications)

# Drafting the Post

Let’s start with the body.

**Body:**

If you’re a freelancer on Upwork, you know the pain:
- Endless job feeds
- Easy to lose track of which gigs you’ve applied to
- Messy notes scattered everywhere

So I built a (simple) Upwork Job Dashboard to tame the chaos.

Here’s what it does:
- Tracks jobs matching your filters—automatically  
- Lets you mark which ones you’ve applied to  
- Shows response rates, deadlines, and quick links  
- (Bonus: Email/Slack notifications for dream gigs)

I built it using:
- Python + Pandas for job scraping/storage  
- Streamlit for a clean, interactive UI  
- (Some light automation to fetch jobs every hour)

Seeing everything at my fingertips genuinely reduced stress—and made my job hunt way more focused.

Thinking of polishing it up and sharing the code with others.
