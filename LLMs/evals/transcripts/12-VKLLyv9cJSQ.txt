I've actually met all these panelists through a series of interviews I did last year or I guess six months ago not even last year where I was just going after top data science Freelancers on upwork and trying to learn from them because I was just this you know you know very much Noob I'm still a noob in many ways but uh even more of a noob six months ago so I thought no better way than to learn from those ahead of me so the first one first person I want to introduce is Nick uh Nick got his bachelor's deg degree in computer science from Cornell University after which he went and um he was at Lincoln lab mit's Lincoln lab where he worked as a research scientist which uh last time we interviewed Nick I was commenting on how impressive that is because I don't see a whole lot of undergrads going into research roles like that uh but at a certain point he I don't know got fed up maybe and he went on to um grer pastures and got his PhD in computer science from uh Unity University of California at Irvine and then after that he entered the world of freelance where he started doing like data science and software engineering uh freelance work so welcome Nick great to have you back uh speaking to the community thanks for having me next I want to introduce Mato Matteo got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering after which he held data science and data engineering roles at a few different companies for one he was at Capital One for a bit then he was at lime tree um but now Matteo's made the transition from being a data freelancer to being a financial planner uh specializing in helping Freelancers kind of stay on track with their finances and whatnot so super excited to have Matteo here to have uh learn more about his journey and perspective on all this stuff thanks Mato yeah thanks for having me and then finally we've got Dimitri who got his uh B bachelor's degree in Business Administration and marketing and then he got a master's in of Science in business analytics and computer science from uh UCL uhit you remind me what UCL is university university uh College London of North London yeah very cool and then Dimitri has been a kind of he's a seasoned veteran freelancer I you know met him on upw work super successful there and a super successful freelancing business um but now Dimitri started a kind of new uh I don't know know what to call it but like Venture with the data freelancer.com where he's imparting all of his wisdom that he's learned in his years freelancing for other people that are trying to break into the space so that's a great resource for anyone that is kind of new to this whole world highly recommend that so thanks for being here Demitri thanks for having me all right so with all the impressive resum√©s uh out of the way we'll just kind of jump into the discussion here so one of the things that we've noticed or at least I've noticed since like coid there was this whole thing called the Great resignation where people were leaving their corporate roles and more people were going into freelance maybe or doing some other kind of work and even now we have these huge companies like the infamous Tech layoffs that we're seeing these days where people are moving you know kind of not by choice but they're leaving these full-time roles and I just kind of want to get everyone's perspective on like what you guys see the future freelance being do you guys see this as like a like a blip like this kind of uh fad where you know people were freelancing because it's cool and fun remote work during coid or people are kind of forced into freelance um because of a layoff um and then in like you know four or five years we'll be back to normal where everyone's working a full-time corporate job again or do you see this as like indicative of a more fundamental shift in how people work and we're gonna and the and that we're going to be seeing more like oneperson companies we're going to see a rise in freelancing um in the future of work so I just want to throw it out there anyone who um kind of wants to catch that and kick us off feel free to go ahead yes I guess I'll start um yes so I think it's like really question of like what role freelancing fills and like a lot of the clients I've got in the past year have been like uh startups or like very small businesses that they may have some VC funding or something like that and they don't really want to hire someone full-time they want hire someone for like 20 or 30 hours a week and I think it's also easier for them to the remote aspect where it's like I think a lot of people are not going to move to some random City to work with a startup that they don't know the founder how reliable it is is um plus it's like a city that has a lot of other stuff around it so I think um for a lot of like startups it might be very helpful um and then regarding the individual aspect um that's one thing I've noticed recently as I've taken larger projects or or just in general is I think it's difficult for clients to see like what like data science and machine learning is and like kind of where the boundaries are between um like managing a project and um like what the data scientist should be doing or what some other like coder should be doing but I think it's more like what I'm trying to switch into is like uh building small teams so I think like the individual idea is difficult and like if I didn't have kind of a background a strong enough background it would be hard for me to work individually um but I think even just in general having at least small teams or communities like this is going to be the way that uh this goes in the future yeah I like that you said like it's flexible for both sides you know it's flexible for the business and the startup or whatever it might be but it's also flexible for the contributors you know they can have multiple clients or they don't have to you know pick up their whole life and move to a city for a job so yeah those are really good points add something to that as well um and especially what uh Co has done to the whole industry I think was before that lots of companies were basically all they want to have their employees on site and very few were kind of um like uh the P Pioneers that uh were leading this whole remote industry um and therefore um I think before when companies were only trusting their employees when they were in-house and they also often wanted to have the Consultants to come over to be in house now after Co they trust their employees they see that work is going so I feel like now even more than before they are way open to work with um not only let's say with foreign entities other uh other Freelancers that are not basically on site and basically provide their service remote oh go ahead and T just say that I'm curious like where the steady state will be you know will be like 30% of people freelance less more because there's certain personality types that I think are drawn to it some are completely scared off of it too um and uh I think the small teams point is is good too because that makes a little bit more stable um helps people get into it and I totally agree that people are much more comfortable with it but there's still you know you hear about all these CEOs back to office my friends at Apple that are like oh I got to go back to work now this sucks and maybe it'll take a little bit more time for more flexible people to get up there because I think it's a great way of working even you know if you could hand someone off hand something off to someone in another time zone pick it up in the morning you know that type of thing is also really cool but uh yeah I'm not sure that it would work for everyone but I think everyone should consider consider because it's it's I like it a lot do you guys think that we need more Freelancers or do you think we have too many Freelancers or it it doesn't really matter like whatever the market decides is is best I wish more managers were okay with Freelancers or didn't have weird contracts that they want every freelancer to sign and then you read it it's like no I'm not signing this and stuff like that I wish it was a little bit more you know and I feel like certain companies um they look at you like a contractor not like a like a trusted advisor someone to actually listen to some people just want to dictate work to you and that doesn't always work the best that's sort of a different type of freelancing yeah so kind of digging into that a bit more like I think this is one thing that you know people who haven't done freelancing before like it's like a Black Swan it's like something they don't even know is a potential problem but like contracts from employers that have undesirable terms in there so like like what are some examples of like things that you would see in a contract and immediately be like no like that doesn't work for me or that's a deal breaker or maybe even just like a red flag um iess I'll start too on this one uh yeah I guess like choice of venue you know people want to sue you in their little city in the middle of nowhere and and that sort of like odd and they have like giant liability RIS that they want you to take ownership of when it's like look I'm using open source Technologies I guess I can buy insurance but beyond that you know I don't want to be totally liable for things so there's that and then there's stuff where it's like clear that they didn't even consider your case they're like none of this data shall leave the office but you're remote worker so just like little things like that it's not even a red flag but just like a let's talk about this but um and then some people I had one client from another industry once um I guess in construction it's more common but he had a lot of penalties and very strict on like the overages or this or that or it was very much like uh we think this is something that is totally scoped out and not something that could be you know different once you see the data so telling me it's going to be 95% accurate it's like well you know I mean you got work with me a little bit or at least give me some time to give you a better ballpark by paying me to work first like so that type of stuff like too rigid I guess I don't know here what other people think too it seemed like you were gonna say something earlier Nick um yes so it's not about the contracts as much as like the ecosystem of Freelancers so I had said I think having the small teams is like the way to go and that's kind of what I'm trying to transition to um but also I think in terms of like the market is like a lot of people don't know what they need and like a lot of times like I get a lot of clients through Consulting calls it's like they may come to you and say like we have a uh llm chatbot problem and it's just like that's just like the only like AI that they know and then you start talking to them and it's like really a more standard data analysis problem or I think they have some machine learning problem and it's not even a machine learning problem um that you don't need to use those tools so I think um I guess my impression is there's a lot of problems and a lot of um like desire out there for these skills but they they don't know how to match them so I think even like having someone to scope out their projects and facilitate like matching them with Freelancers and deciding exactly what they need is something that's missing right now yeah I see that and this kind of goes into what you were doing Demetri with like data strategy yes and that's what I just want to say um is when I started um I mean my background I mean I always work with marketing team so always when I started freelancing I always position myself as the marketing data scientist and I always try to focus on marketing data projects but um as uh nict said uh it's I think very common that lots of people are not educated on uh the different data projects the different data problems out there so I basically saw this and uh when I talked uh to many let's say prospects because at the end it didn't turn into client and because this was always the case because they thought they needed something but they needed something else it was still data related but for them it's just they have this cloud of data in their head and uh that's why um uh I decided uh to basically as I have this uh background in business basically to go a little bit back and educate those um companies uh around that and basically do the project scoping with them understand what do they actually need because nowadays every company wants to be data driven they often don't actually know what it means I mean even if we ask each other we probably all have different definitions for it or different understandings of it and um the whole thing is that I see too many clients that invest at least in the marketing side they want to have some data pipelines they want to have some dashboards that's usually the the case the the the main project that they always think about some marketing dashboard and then then what how do you use the dashboard how do you what are all the next steps and yeah so basically that's why I moved also to um more data strategy Consulting yeah those uh those are always my best contracts where when I knew the client thought they needed something and I could really convince them that this is what they actually need and I'm the expert because you come in with so much more thrust but then I'm sure um you know focusing more on that which is kind of what I want to do more too or did want to do at a time but now I've sort of transition more in financial planning but that's like the fun the funnest part for me I think what maybe you're trying to do more of Nick too um and the MRI as well yeah and I love that you guys brought this up because so um we all met in my first round of interviews on upwork but I actually recently did a second round of interviews and one of the things that came up over and over again is that a common mistake that a lot of Freelancers will make early on is that they don't get that Clarity of scope at the outset and now you're like throwing that in with clients don't really know what they want and you know you know you might be coming in with all this like technical knowledge or maybe they heard all these buzzwords and you're trying to like close the gap between like what they need and what they think they need so I don't know how do you guys navigate that um at the outset like when working with prospects like not even clients yet but you know how do you guide that conversation I guess I'll I'll say something on that um so I think that that's actually a huge problem is that uh kind of like I was saying before is like I feel like they're trying to manage you like sometimes they think like they're the project manager it's not like I haven't had anyone like kind of boss you around be like oh no you shouldn't be doing this like you should be doing it this way like they'll work with you but I still feel like they try to do more than they're capable of doing and it's like they kind of tell you a little bit about the project and they might tell you some vague things about like oh like we're going to use this for this and don't worry about that and then once you actually get to that it's like like this completely didn't work and I should have done something different earlier on and they just want a deliverable like Prett immediately so I think that as I switch to do more like advisory or like project scoping and like management it's just going to be easier to facilitate because it's like they don't know that like that's a job that like to have a clear scope and like clear requirements and clear like check points like especially about the data because it's like with coding it's like you can get a bug and it just doesn't work but with data it's like you have a pipeline and it's putting data through the pipeline it's going to the next stages but unless you're putting in the right checks and looking at it and analyzing it uh you don't really know what's happening in the middle and it doesn't throw an error so it's like to them they don't really understand like how big of an issue that is so I think it's like the way I think now is like if I were like the manager it's like my job is to make this scope like clear and like that that's my job and then the other guy is going to do the coding so like from their perspective like that's how it would look and it's like I think now it's like as a onep person team they're like oh we just kind of vaguely tell you and then you code it up um so I think having like a actual physical person that's like the guy who makes the scope in the specifications would make it easier for them yeah I think that's a great Point like you know I'm I'm was definitely guilty of this as like you know coming from like a senior data scientist role just like a data scientist role you know you have a certain mindset you're not really thinking like a project manager you're not thinking like a manager you're just thinking about the technology and so it's easy to kind of jump into the project with like tools first and not really making a plan and so like making that distinction in your mind between you know well there's this like technical role there's like the data scientist role but then there's also the project manager role and giving both like the proper amount of attention and uh time U I don't know Demetri how how was that conversation typically gone for you like since you were doing more of like the project manager role when working with clients I started again with the uh the lead let's say the the former leads companies that I I knew that they had a data problem but I at the past I always basically passed the month like no that's not what I do um and I reached out back to them and tried to um TR to basically uh reignite their conversation and after um uh do you still have that data problem and then they sometimes say like yes yes I do it and tell them like and then basically I come in with my service offering where I basically say I'll try to uh help you gain Clarity um we scope the project uh you have me as a data person helping you finding out whate of data person you actually need for that and yeah and often for them that's such a big relief because uh again often it's someone higher up in the food chain basically told them that they should should do that and uh now they don't know how to get it done and they just need someone but they often don't know who that's why they went on um maybe different platforms or they reach out to their Network and ask do you know a data guy and that's usually um how the conversation works yeah and you know another thing that I've been because this is like my world now like uh this past couple months like I've really gone all in on freelancing and this project manager stuff and client relations stuff has really like slapped me in the face in many ways and so I'm curious like what like when you guys are doing that first engagement like talking to a prospect like they said they have some problem they reached out to you or you found them through upwork or whatever means um like what are you asking these clients to kind of dig in peel back the layers of the onion to get to like the core like problem that they're facing and ultimately like solving the problem they actually have as opposed to the problem that they might think that they have start go ahead you go ahead sorry um so um in my case I um I have like my little checklist of questions that I always try to go through because otherwise I'm a very Chetty person and I get lost in conf ation with them and I uh basically what I try is ask very open question about um uh what's on their mind you know what types of a problem they have I tried to let them explain it to me what they think is the problem and uh every time I kind of smelled something I tried to steer that conversation um in that uh regard I asked him how can I help you so I tried to let them be basically the doctor in that case and PR like self diagnose themselves but in in that process basically my questions basically give me enough input to understand okay should I ask this question or this question so for me it's very important to ask open-end questions um let them uh um basically uh tell me as much as uh they know and at the end my goal is out of all these uh basically after I ask them a bunch of questions and open questions is understand what they don't know and that's where I try to land my key question um and my key question is always like um again I asked them a specific uh thing that I pointed out that they clearly don't know about it and I ask them and I keep following up on that and that makes them um unsure because often times it's some sort of manager that they they talk to another basically freelancer that wants to sell to them and I Tred to switch that whole conversation um that it's more like I'm asking a question that you don't know so suddenly you switch a new start listening to me when I when I say something because you you clearly don't know so yeah that's usually the process how I um the initial pH I think that's a fantastic way to do it just like you're learning from them they're teaching you and you're allowing them to drive the conversation and just maybe nudging it in particular directions um you know to kind of get a deeper understanding of what their problem is uh Mato you were gonna say something but uh you know yeah yeah sure uh you know I guess based on what dri said sort of changed what say now but uh yeah earlier in my career um with upw workking things you know you sent a lot of proposals and you're like what are you doing it's not you're not closing as much maybe you're focusing on too many types of jobs and not niching enough but I read some sales books and things and more thinking about like the client psychology of it like Demetri saying getting them to talk and be their own doctor is kind of interesting because I found if you sort of get them to make the jump to the point where they really need to hire you by sort of um not going too fast with trying to sell them but not going too slow either and trying to um you know really understand why they are hiring you what are they hoping to achieve from this relationship and then you know you want to make sure they're confident enough you don't want to have unsuccessful clients I would hope and um uh trying to be more specific here um you know try really understand all the things they might be missing because like toet was saying they might hear about some technology so I work a lot with PDFs and people are like oh I just used Tess and this I'm like well you have a PDF all the data is in it already potentially and you can you have a lot of OCR issues if used test direction if I tell the client that specific Insight then they're like oh this guy actually knows what he's talking about and that builds confidence and then you can slowly build another specific problem but again not going too fast but going to the point where like you should hire me I'll do an exploration I'll show you my method Works quickly here's the deliverables and then that can lead it to you know the longer work and hopefully at that point they have enough confidence in you that they'll listen to you and hire for you that hire you for that but uh you know being a solo too it's kind of hard to you know a bit of a journalist with some specialist like maybe like the t-shape as people say but you know they don't want to listen to you on too much other stuff they sort of want a guy for this a guy for that or you know consultant for that and it's hard to really demonstrate expertise in my opinion without being a little bit more formal um and that's something I think I've struggled with too um if you're more formally a project manager more formally a a team you know they might Trust on you a bit more and get you to listen to you on actually solving the real problems too yeah I'll add to that that I I think um like the initial consultation is important for talking with the client and um I think from their perspective like if you're talking about the problem and you give them good ideas and you're asking good questions like that's what kind of gets them to higher you and I think most of the like larger contracts I've had have started off as like like 10 hours a week or like a small amount so I think they kind of like hire you so they're kind of testing you but also like understanding like what their problem is and then it's always been like oh like we like what you're doing like we want to see more done this week like here's like another 10 hours and like oh now we want more done so it's like it's kind of like ramped up um but I think also um for me what's helped me keep clients and has like kind of helped manage their expectations is like to show them like the data analysis a little bit and to make videos like I make a like a 10 or 15 minute video every week showing like this is the the results I'm getting like this is what the code looks like or maybe not so much the code but like these are what the plots look like this is what the data looks like and um if there would be like a good classification for this data we would see like we make like 2D plots we would see like separation between these two classes and like we're not seeing that and therefore like this needs to be rethought in some way so I think yeah it's just like it's kind of their first experience like really getting in with data and seeing all the problems that can arise so if they see that happening they're I think more willing to work with you but um I guess they're not really transparent it's like I could see it from their end like they don't want to just dump like T of thousands of dollars off and hope that eventually something's going to work without seeing why it's not working or why it's taking time or the whole process I was going say something but I think I forgot but uh we are kind of like running a little over time so I just want to ask one more question to the panel and we'll open it up for the Q&A um and so you know what's like the long-term play like what does a long-term career look like as a freelancer because like in corporate you know it's a pretty wellp paved path you know you kind of get in and you just kind of keep climbing the ranks you go from you know individual contributor to like a manager to like a director and so on and so forth but in freelance it's not so clear and I often see you know different Freelancers with different uh Visions for themselves so I'm just curious to kind of see what everyone's Vision here uh is for themselves like what's the long-term goal like what are you hoping to get out of this uh like data freelancing career so I guess I'll start so I said this kind of at the last interview that um so kind of ramping up and being successful was my goal the past few years and I think now trying to do more teamwork um is going to be like next year or two and then um also having worked with like dozens or uh like startups and small businesses just seeing what it takes to build a startup so I might like I'm more ambitious to do that right now so do my own projects and that's kind of why I likeed freelancing is if I wanted to cut the hours down to like 20 a week and then work on my own projects that's something I could do whereas like if you have a 40 hour week job you can't just tell them like I want to work 20 hours a week for the next two months um so working on my own projects and the uh substack writing projects that I'm working on that's kind of my longterm goals what about you mat yeah so for me something I wrestled with a lot was like should I start a consulting company hire people and do that and I don't know I really like the um you know it's hard to finesse your clients just right but to get it to a point where nothing's too urgent that you're needed next stay or hopefully within a week ideally and then really having like ultimate flexibility but then maintaining that is hard because you got to still stay sharp you can't get too comfortable with your clients so you know I think my path has been I guess I'm still doing freelancing but in financial planning um and I think there's a lot of interesting things I can do there but long term I do like doing service work that's most successful things I've always been doing things for providing projects someone wants and being done like kind of as a mercenary and um probably still doing that but yeah I don't know I'm still doing startup stuff and but for me it just sort of you know as a freelancer you can really make a lot of money um with hourly rates and Project based billing um and have that flexibility um to not always work all the time and that's what really I'm trying to do if I can just keep bumping up the hourly rate you know in my opinion I feel like some of the computer stuff's gotten a little bit more complex to start charging High RS you know guess frequently enough switching to another industry I think if I have the expertise I can do pretty well with um and then be more flexible to do other Rand Adventures like who knows make the terrible financial decision to open a restaurant or something but yeah I'd eat there and Vegas is popping for restaurant so you're in the right City not too much competition what about you Demetri I think Mato his last point was um something that uh um kind of Define defines the whole freelancer spirit and uh I mean I mean you wear the hat the data entrepreneur and I think that's the beauty um we all have a skill set um and we like to basically provide our services but it doesn't mean that your career is defined by just that service because as a as a freelancer you don't just do that one thing that you were hired as in a company but you do sales you do marketing you do so much stuff suddenly um maybe you want to build your own website you start figuring out so many new interest that you had before and uh again it might be out of the data World um it might be a different one again it could be anything and I think that's the beauty of it that um it provides you with the freedom of really trying out different stuff and as soon as as no as long as you found basically that one thing that basically gives you let's say enough let's say money to um support your life and be happy once you figure that out you have enough time experiment other things again you could just work out more in the gym or you can try out new Ventures do the restaurant thing or any other stuff and that I think that's the beauty of it so what's that going to look like for you is it going to be the data freelancer.com is it going to be just more Consulting is it going to be something else entirely no I mean again I I went to data Consulting and advisory just because I I think I'm not the best data scientist uh and by far I mean I see too many people out there that I cannot compete with and I don't want to provide some service to my client just because they know me and uh again I enjoy the strategy side of it and um not that much the implementation side so for me definitely the um data strategy is the long-term plan um and uh in terms of the data freelancer um again right now it's just let's say a site project um again I like to sh I'm I'm a mentor also at University so I I have that thing where I really enjoy um being part of the like this panel here and um if again my advice helps someone then hey I'm happy so at the moment just uh again fun but hey again that's the entrepreneurship uh you know that you the hat that you wear and maybe um maybe I can monetize that but again that's not it's not the goal for the beginning that's awesome all right let's open it up for questions so if you guys got questions drop it in the chat raise your hand we'll pull you up on stage we've have a tremendous amount of experience on the stage here uh very successful Freelancers at least uh as far as I can tell from upwork revenue um probably cumulative over a million dollar in Revenue just on upor so this is uh you know uh this your opportunity to learn all right here we go Sam has a question come on up Sam there we go can y'all hear me yes awesome well thanks so much it's been a it's been a good chat I've enjoyed listening to y'all one of the things I've been thinking about recently I just kind of kicked off this journey a couple months ago uh in the the Consulting freelancing world I'm currently on a an hourly project uh with a consulting firm with an end client so the question here is mostly like thinking longterm right how do you how do you build out that incoming funnel so I would I would call myself right now A a contractor but I want to move into that Consulting space um so how do you build out that funnel to start to get incoming business or at least make that first conversation right with a potential client less painful so I've been reading things like you shouldn't do anything else other than just write articles and write books and that should be the only thing you do to kind of prove out your your experience and knowledge but I see other people right that have YouTube channels and have Instagram channels that create reads so reals so I'm just thinking like what has been yall strategy and kind of The Proven strategy that you've used in your experience to build out that that incoming funnel and be able to prove out your experience and make those conversations less painful yeah I would say for me working on upwork um getting reviews like first five or six reviews after you get that you're pretty much validated in the eyes of a lot of clients so uh just like take whatever jobs you need to get that and preferably like shorter jobs that are easy that you can do in like a day ideally that you could complete it get a good review and um that helps a lot of clients um so that's been my experience on that platform i' also say uh with upw work a cool thing you can do is you know you have your existing contract right now you know your skill set um you can look on work to see who gets jobs by just throwing the job idea I think it still works maybe you do that already and um you know you can see who gets it what their background is and try to match your skill path to that but um another thing with freelancing to get more of the funnel you know I haven't done the best in this area but I'm trying more now um like Word of Mouth even being here you know looking at the job board you know getting that first touch with a person like actually talking to a human being able to get in front of them and understand their problem I think that's really important too just the word of mouth however you can do it um will help you get the referrals my side um my main strategy from the beginning was um relationships and therefore getting referral and um I did that by when I started out I reached out to almost every um colleague I had uh over the past I told them that what I was doing I told them if someone needs help with data um I'm the data guy for them um once I got some clients through upward work off up work as a matter I try to mingle um with them a lot um try to be kind of like a had a friendly relationship with them so far that uh even even nowadays I um I try to um reach out to them once in a while I even try I even sent most of them Christmas cards uh again I just tried to the relationship side um because I feel like yeah I probably there tons of ways of getting U inbound clients um but I mean takes time to write good articles get CEO get traffic and all that stuff for me it's I talk to people right away it's so much faster so that was always my strategy I'll just add one thing on the funnel side um yeah I'll I'll make it quick um so I've most actually all my clients right now and leads are coming from inbound leads from my YouTube videos and my medium articles um and that you know is a has its pros and cons as well um but I don't think it so I guess the one thing about that is it takes time I've been making content for three years and so it's kind of like three years in the making the I'm getting leads from articles I wrote two years ago so it's not something that's going to get you the immediate um return on investment probably upwork is going to get you more immediate results um and then probably U referrals so I guess there's something to be said about diversifying how you get leads um of course that's not necessary because you know everyone here has not Diversified found a way to be successful sorry M what were you gonna say that's exactly what I was going to say just that SEO that that's the long game it can work out really well I think but it's you know potentially years to see the return unless you get vial somehow but yeah thank you all very much yeah thanks Sam see all right so we had another question from Lori I guess we kind of touched on it but does anyone have experience in freelancing on upwork and would like to share so I don't know Nick mato to if you guys want to add any color from the earlier comments um yeah I guess I'll just say that um I chose that platform because it seemed to be the one that had the most jobs and like at least decent length contracts like I think stuff like Fiverr is just more like oneoff um and then there's other ones that are like top tow that um you have to apply to get into and um guess I looked at that a few years ago and I didn't do it because it looked like it needed like a a three-week like trial project and I didn't want to spend that time to get in there and I didn't know like what the um clients were like in there and all the other stuff so I guess I just didn't do and up was successful for me so I stuck with that but I don't know if other people have success on other platforms that would be good to find out mat I know you are super successful in upwork as well I don't know any kind of Reflections uh maybe tips for those that might be earlier in their upwork journey I just I think finding a niche is a good idea and I think what we said earlier about maybe matching your profile to like you get five jobs and that shows you credibility if you get those five jobs and something you want to specialize in that's helpful um some things maybe if you look at the your preferred work life balance maybe that's not the right type of job some full stack roles in my experience want more hours per week than a data science job for instance um but yeah really once I started niching I applied to things less and I closed more and aggregate so trying out different niches you can even have like three per se but I think upwork lets you show your Prof profile differently too based on your niches um and start exploring that way um would be a good way to go make it more tangible but you also have to be critical with yourself don't think you can do something and then like you're not a neural network expert or something without you know some more pedigree probably so that's a trickier one um but you know bit of reflection iterating you know just one last thing to that um because yesterday or the other day I was um basically making a video right about basically the market dynamics of uh basically the data freelance scape and um again everyone talks about niching and I think Niche if you find that Niche you're able to command higher prices and um and probably have a very um positioning towards the clients that you like to attract however there are tons of people out there that also want to be Freelancers and maybe they are more Junior they don't or they have tried they have worked on very different um data projects so they don't know exactly what their need is and um I don't want to discourage those people and think that even a generalist um approach can work but again it's you need to have your strategy you know need to know that if you're for example very good in python or um Excel or any other tool out there and you know that people are asked for this skill um you might at the beginning uh as Nick said uh to get the first the wins basically on upw work you know compete on price and go very low maybe there are other ways how you can get those projects um promise the client I know deliver on a specific time frame um guarantees I know there are so many other things that clients want want and um even as a generalist You Can level up uh the price depending on how you basically sell your value and your value is not just your python skill but it's your communication it's the promises it's so much more yeah that's a really good points we had another question from Chris uh I'll just read the whole thing aloud I recently heard of some design Freelancers solopreneurs who would productize their services charging on a tiered subscription basis would you think this is something that we can do in the data field and then they linked a a reference video um I know that uh I know that video I've seen that and I also know a guy on LinkedIn that uh has a productized data service and it looks the same thing like if if you're not familiar watch this video that uh Chris just posted but there's a someone on LinkedIn guy from Austria I don't remember his name right now um and he basically has this uh basically built a surface around said how good that works I don't know but again there are so many ways of doing business and if you think um that style works for you um why not I think uh I once consider doing this because I went to a bike shop and they were selling me on tuning my bike and they're like here's the light package the medium and the big and I think for certain things where you know what you're doing that can be a good way to frame and also with the price psychology like uh you don't want this you don't want that can kind of manipulate it with data Maybe on like training models you could do a light version um and then like the more advanc is using like a lot more training time of gpus but I think um you know with product I Services it helps if you really know how much they do cost or you have some Runway to get an idea for that because once you know your margins then it's great but I think also just in the contract terms you know if you give people options that's another way close a sale that's a little interesting I think um just to put one more on top of the fake um that's because I feel like sometimes those videos they they are made in a way that when I watch them I think like w that's very cool very smart idea um but again it doesn't mean that that's the best way of making money because for example how this basically business model works is you um um get paid a flat fee over uh like like a subscription from the clients but you basically promise them to do one work at a time so that's why they cannot overload you with work so in the case if you are on some projects lower because you cannot always estimate the type of projects they give you um you cannot really Define it uh for them then again you might be slow you know you could have done so much more other projects and actually earn more um on the other side it sounds like a very let's say people are fall in love with the subscription model so some people think that's the way the only it goes I mean Netflix and all those big companies do that but again it really needs to fit your St the way you work um your clients your positioning your marketing so there's so much behind that but again um if you watch the video I mean it sounds cool and everyone thinks that's the way to go so we got uh one maybe two more questions uh so one is from samur or samur uh when starting as a data freelancer does it depend on a certain skill SL tool to build your portfolio so I guess do you um if I'm interpreting this correctly um do you need like a particular set of skills to get started in this industry I think instead of focusing on skills focus on what you can do which is slightly different from a skill um because in freelancing people are less concerned you know like when you apply to normal job it's like what's your resume um where have you learned what can we teach you where is the freelancer sometimes they're looking for you to do something they know you can do um but um trying to think on it depend on a certain skill yeah I mean there's certain skills and tools that are in demand and all that and there can be some research done to figure out what best suits you but I think it's more about just really focus on the results and then the skill will you know come from that like learning the coolest programming language or Library may not be as necessary unless maybe you're in the front end space or something but uh yeah I'd focus on what you can do more think Excel is a fine tool even you know it works for a lot of companies even though it's not as advanced and you could do quite a lot of things just with that any other thoughts we got uh one question here and maybe one more incoming uh want to make sure we get to all the questions all right let's see there's another one uh Pringle men said thanks a lot for the session any tips for keeping yourself motivated when starting out in the beginning it can be hard to find the first few clients in projects I think this is a very relatable question I see nicking forward um um yeah I guess I I think I told you my story was I finished PhD and then I uh like did not want to work for big Tech or Academia because of the culture there um and and basically my motivation was just to survive financially so make enough to live so I had like probably a lower standard than people would have if they're coming in with like a standard data science job and they expect to make that salary with 40 hours a week um right off the bat so I guess my standards were lower than other people's but um that was I guess that was my motivation was I just did not want to work for these companies and these institutions and if I could survive financially then I was very motivated to do that and um so I think it I don't know maybe to generalize it just like find what what motivates you and what your goals are and um to not really expect maybe in the first year that you're going to Eclipse if you have a current salary and just be be satisfied with that so have realistic expectations and survival is the best motivator that was my take away from that that was for me yeah also I'll add on to that that like a community like this wasn't around like a few years ago so I think having community of people that you could work with and even like share tips and to kind of like work together and struggle together with I think is very useful yeah I definitely I agree and then also uh for me what was helpful is like you know even while you're building your profile like you're making way less than you hope to make in the future um zooming out and looking at the big picture like a okay I got this job that means I have much better chance of getting this job which means after that I can get this job and doing that from time to time helps but there's you know there's definitely some low points freelancing where it's like will you get that next stepping stone so to speak to get the experience to get the the jobs that you want um but yeah it's yeah say the big picture helped me a lot like you're building um oh yeah go ahead um from my side it's I think probably business answer and I would say have a purpose because when I started out I worked uh s years for different companies before and I think I was always a um tough employee uh sometimes because I often wasn't happy how people use data or the type of projects we worked and I also worked before for Google partner consulting firm and sometimes we sold projects to clients and I was like man that total to the client and I always thought if I would be my own business I want to work on stuff that really helps people and um that was kind of let's say my guiding star of course survival and the financial part is critical for that but um I told myself every project I will do I will become the friend to my clients I will try to advise them as I would advise my mother basically and uh yeah so that's was my motivator all right awesome um we went uh over a little bit but I didn't want to cut off the great conversations and all the questions that we receiv so well we'll probably cut it off there um if you guys have any follow-up questions you know feel free to DM me and I'll share with the panelist or feel free to reach out to the panelists on LinkedIn or

discussion but open to everyone so anyone can kind of share their perspective or share what problems they're you know facing right now and then you get uh feedback from other people you know other
