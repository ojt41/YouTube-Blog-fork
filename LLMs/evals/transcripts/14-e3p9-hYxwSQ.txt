AI has changed a lot since I started 6 years ago while there are more learning resources available than ever figuring out where to start is a challenge in this video I'll talk about how I'd approach learning AI given what I know now and the tools available today and if you're new here welcome I'm sha I make videos about data science and Entrepreneurship if you enjoy this content please consider clicking the Subscribe button that's a great no cost way you can support me in all the videos that I make I've worked in AI for the past 6 years I started as a researcher while getting my PhD then worked as a data scientist at Toyota and now I teach people AI while Building Products on the side although I still have a lot to learn the fstep approach I share here is based on what I've personally found helpful in navigating this space if I were to boil it all down the central principle of my Approach is to learn by doing where each step outlines a clear and specific objective through which completion will naturally develop key skills in other words rather than reviewing a list of Concepts and courses each step is a task designed to force me to learn key skills by completing it if starting from zero the first thing I would do is familiarize myself with modern AI tools like chat PT Claude or the like this is important because frequently using these tools will give me a practical understanding of what what these models can do it'll also develop my ability to use them effectively through prompting alone on a more meta level these chat interfaces are amazing tools for learning Ai and really anything else I'd use chat gbt to explain confusing buzzwords and Technical Concepts like llms tokens apis rag Etc and be sure to ask followup questions until I have a clear understanding of each idea for those that don't click I'd seek alternative resources using Google search and YouTube although I could go far with today's no code AI tools they are still fundamentally limited namely these tools can easily be used to build custom Solutions or process data in bulk that's why the next thing I would do is install python on my machine python is the industry standard programming language for AI development to get it installed I'd ask chat GPT for step-by-step instructions if I got stuck I'd go back to chat gbt explain the issue and ask it for guidance while using chadt or any other AI assistant in this way can significantly streamline this process I would still take the time to understand each key step of the process and ask follow-up questions as needed this is an important Habit to develop because it'll help avoid accumulating technical debt which I'd have to pay for later when something goes wrong once I've become comfortable with chaty BT and installed python on my machine my next step would be to build a simple automation using python my approach to generating project ideas would be to think of things I consistently use chat gbt for and try to implement it in Python this would require me to become familiar with open ai's python API so I'd start reading through their documentation and reviewing example code there once I felt comfortable with the API I'd start writing python code my first step would be to Think Through each step of my automation for example if I wanted to summarize research papers the steps might be one read the paper contents into python two construct a prompt for gp40 and three make an open AI API call if I got stuck I'd go to chat GPT for assistance for instance if I didn't know how to read PDFs into python I would ask chat GPT for help if it spits out code that I don't understand I'd ask follow-up questions until I understood each line again it is important I take this approach to coding with chat GPT because blindly copy pasting code wouldn't really teach me much it would also acre unforgiving technical debt in other words I'd get short-term gains but would have to pay for them later through technical difficulties and headaches after step three becomes easy for me I'd seek out more sophisticated prod projects rather than making chat GPT like API calls I'd buil a project that required me to use an embedding model or train a model myself for this I'd use hugging faces Transformers library and find a pre-trained model that's relevant to my project on the hugging face Hub potential project ideas might be things like a semantic Search tool a basic rag chatbot clustering documents based on similarity training a text classifier using embeddings or fine-tuning a large language model for example if I went with the rag project I'd first educate myself about Rag by watching YouTube videos then I'd break down my system's basic components and the steps to implement it finally I'd start coding the project using Chachi as a co-pilot like in step three although I would have learned a lot about the technical side of AI through doing projects in steps three and four when it comes to generating value with AI this is not enough for that I need to use what I learned to solve real world problems there are two ways to do this I could one solve my own problems or two solve someone else's problems since I hopefully already did the former in steps three and four here are a few ways I'd approach the latter one I'd reach out to business owners and Professionals in my network two if I was a student I'd join a research group at my University three I'd look for an internship again if I was a student or four I'd find a freelance gig on upwork let's say I'd already graduated college and wasn't quite confident enough to start looking for freelance gigs that leaves me with option one for this I'd start by making a list of people I could reach out to Ideal contacts would be small business owners or professionals working at small to mediumsized businesses then I would craft a message template and reach out to everyone on my list through Linkedin DMS or email if I struggle to find the right wording I'd again turn to chat GPT for help although AI involves an interdisciplinary set of technical skills and knowledge with today's tools and resources it's never been more accessible that said it's important to remember that learning itself is hard you will get confused you will get frustrated and you will wonder why you're putting yourself through this struggle however if you are patient and persistent you will be rewarded with Clarity if you have questions or you want feedback on project ideas feel free to share them in the comments and as always thank you so much for your time and thanks for watching
