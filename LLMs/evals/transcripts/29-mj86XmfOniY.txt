yeah hey guys welcome my name is sean i'm a physics phd student at the university of texas dallas and in this video i'll be talking about the fourier transform i know there's tons maybe not even tons thousands millions of videos about fourier transforms on youtube but i just wanted to post a quick digestible video on the topic mainly to serve as a primer for my next two videos which will be on the fast fourier transform and something called the wavelet transform by no means am i an expert in any of these topics i just use them sometimes in my research in the future i'll be posting more videos relating to physics research data science machine learning so stay tuned for those again i'm not an expert in these topics so if you hear me say something stupid make a mistake say something wrong i invite you to please leave a comment let me know i'm gonna do my best to read all the comments and reply to them if you find this video helpful and you want to see more like in the future uh subscribe like share comment all that good stuff all right without any further ado let's get into the video so everyone's undoubtedly familiar with time series even even if you haven't heard the term so time series is simply a set of values indexed by time so you flip on your favorite news network you they're typically talking about how stocks are amazing or stocks are terrible or whatever and typically they're showing uh like a stock price or here we have an index price uh plotted over time so we have time on the x-axis and we have the price on the y-axis um or even more uh relevant to our daily lives seven day forecast so here we have uh the temperature plotted over time so these are time series it's just a set of values indexed over time so a signal is a specific kind of time series the only difference here is a signal typically represents a physical event uh so for example you could be listening to your favorite record that could be represented as an audio signal so you have like this time oscillating amplitude uh or so a lot of times it's going to be a voltage or you could have a biometric signal so this is something i deal with in my research uh here we have the surface body temperature plotted over time so time series signals very common everyone's probably really familiar with them this is just terminology okay so another very common thing and is very fundamental to understanding the fourier transform is waves so a wave is simply an any oscillating quantity around an equilibrium so there are two basic properties of waves amplitude which is the magnitude of the quantity and frequency which characterizes the oscillation so here we have a sine wave so the amplitude is characterized by the y-axis and the frequency is characterized by the number of peaks in a given time interval so now getting to the bread and butter the main topic main event of the video the fourier transform so before we transform intuitively is a decomposition of a signal into sines and cosines so here we have this purple signal f x plotted over time if we do the fourier transform it turns out we can decompose this into two simple sine waves of different frequencies and the way we do this is via the 40 transform which is given by this expression so we have f of k is equal to the infinite integral of f x which is our signal our time series or function whatever you want to plug in there times e to the minus 2 pi i k x dx um and if you're confused then i've been talking about sines and cosines and you don't see a sine or cosine in this expression i just want to put here as a reminder we have euler's formula which relates e to the x to cosine and sine so another way to think of the fourier transform is in simple terms is if we have a signal plotted over time uh a 40 transform simply changes our x-axis from time to frequency so here we have the same signal uh it's made up of those two simple sine waves as we saw in the previous slide so if you were to compute the fourier transform and plot the resulting what they call power spectrum uh resulting from the fourier transform you get something that looks like this bottom plot so we have two spikes at one hert and two hertz so this is just another way of thinking of the fourier transform so in the previous slide it was expressed in terms of x and k so x is usually like a spatial coordinate and k is typically like a what they call a wave number which as has units of inverse space and here we have things in terms of time t and angular frequency omega which is defined in this way two pi times the frequency the code to generate these plots is available on the github so check that out so here we're kind of getting into the practical applications of the 4u transform spectral analysis is just one of many applications of before you transform uh so spectral analysis is uh simply the examination of a signal so again it could be your audio signal your body temperature over time based on its constituent frequency energies so this is applications in uh you can look at the spectrum of light so we're all familiar with perhaps the pink floyd album dark side of the moon white light comes in rainbow comes out because white light is made up of basic constituent frequencies of different colors you can extend this idea to different light sources like the sun or led bulbs in your house or fluorescent bulbs in your house or if you are if you're really struggling incandescent bulbs also spectral analysis is very relevant to audio production i'm a musician this is something i do a lot you can kind of turn down or turn up different frequency values or ranges of your audio signal and this is relevant to make your music or any kind of audio speech given a lecture or something you can make the audio sound a lot better doing this kind of audio production and then finally something i do and deal with in my research is eeg which is measuring the surface brain activity so you can understand eeg signals you can look at them through the lens of their frequency bands some very widely used uh frequency ranges of eeg are the delta theta alpha and beta band and you may have heard of like alpha waves or beta waves in popular culture so that's what they're referencing so that was before you transform stay tuned for the next video on the fast 40 transform which makes this idea more practical again like and subscribe if you found this video helpful please leave a comment i'd love to hear your feedback i'm a phd student like i said earlier so i'm learning posting these videos as part of the learning process see you next time see you next time until next time catch you later you
