hey folks welcome back this is the first video in a three-part series on topological data analysis or tda for short tda is an up-and-coming approach to data analysis that focuses on looking at the shape of data this first video will serve as a brief introduction to the topic setting the stage for the next two videos which talk about two specific techniques the mapper algorithm and persistent homology so without any further ado let's get into the video so starting place for all this is the observation that data volumes across different domains seem to be increasing at an accelerating rate and in many cases this is a good thing for example it served as the fuel for so many of the technological innovations in the past decade or so like image search or recommendation systems natural language processing and so on but there's a problem mo data often means mo problems and any practitioner will tell you data from the real world is often noisy and high dimensional and so that's where topological data analysis or tda for short can help and the catch phrase for tda often goes something like data has shape and shape matters so the basic basic idea of tda is to take data and translate it into some kind of shape so the reason this is helpful is that the underlying shape of our data is often much more robust to noise and perturbations that our data generating process may undergo and additionally all the tda algorithms that extract shape from data at least the ones that we will discuss in the series are readily applicable to very high dimensional data sets so all in one package we can both handle the problem of noisy data and high dimensional data with this single framework of topological data analysis so the first key word in the acronym tda topological comes from the mathematical field of topology and the story of topology goes back to a famous problem called the seven bridges of konigsberg and so koenigsberg is an old city which looks something like the image we have here on the left so koenigsberg can be described as these four land masses sitting to the north south east and in the center connected by seven bridges and that's what's being shown in this image here and so the famous problem goes something like this what path crosses all seven bridges without visiting a single bridge more than once so i'll try to say that again in different words so is there a path on this map of konigsberg where we can cross all seven bridges but only visit each bridge a single time so if you want you can take a moment to try to find such a path but it would be futile because no such path exists it's one thing to say it but to demonstrate this mathematically took the work of a very famous mathematician leonard euler and so the way euler solved this problem is by drawing a picture of konigsberg but not like the picture we see on the left here the picture that euler drew was much more simple and it looks something like this it's just a collection of circles connected by lines and today we call this type of picture a graph and we call these circles vertices or nodes and then we call these connections between nodes edges or links and so what this picture what this graph is representing is actually konigsberg where each circle corresponds to a land mass in konigsberg and every line represents a bridge and we have two circles are connected by a line if the corresponding land masses are connected by a bridge so what euler did in drawing this picture drawing this graph is he boiled down this map of konigsberg to the essential elements which eventually allowed him to solve this problem so what euler did all those years ago is basically what we're doing when we do topological data analysis so we take data we can consider this map of konigsberg as data and we want to extract the fundamental shape of this data so as you can imagine there are countless ways in which we can take data and translate it into its underlying shape or structure so in other words there are a lot of ways in which we can do topological data analysis so there's this very nice review article uh by chazal and michelle i probably butchered those names so i apologize but the reference is given here at the bottom so in this article they describe a generalized pipeline for topological data analysis it goes something like this you start with your data you translate that data into some shape some underlying structure it could be a graph just like euler did or it could be something else and from that shape you extract top logical features then you can use those features to inform analysis which can range from just basic statistics all the way to very sophisticated machine learning models so the motivation for this series is that when i was first exposed to topological data analysis it was really exciting i would see these really cool and engaging visualizations applied to very diverse set of problems such as discovering new subtypes of cancer or defining new roles based on basketball statistics or even describing the evolution of politics in the united states but that the problem came when i started to dive a bit more into the details of topological data analysis and i was met with this a wall of terminology in jargon which isn't a bad thing mathematical rigor associated with topological analysis is a good thing a lot of the techniques under the umbrella of topological data analysis are very well founded mathematically but as a non-mathematician as an outsider so to speak trying to figure out what's going on here there was just a barrier to entry to use this stuff in practice and so my goal in this series is to put the terminology aside to a large extent and focus on two main goals one i'd like to highlight key ideas from topological data analysis for non-mathematicians and two i want to share ready to use example codes that showcase what topological data analysis can do so in the next two videos i will be talking about two specific techniques respectively the first technique is called the mapper algorithm what this algorithm provides is something very similar to what euler did we will take any generic data set and we will translate it into a graph then in the following video we will discuss another specific technique under the umbrella of topological data analysis called persistent homology so i
