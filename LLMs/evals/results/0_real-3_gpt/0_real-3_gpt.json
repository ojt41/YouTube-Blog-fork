Here, I will discuss prompt engineering\n(PE) and how to use it to build LLM-enabled applications. I start by reviewing\nkey PE techniques and then walk through Python example code of using LangChain\nto build an LLM-based application.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZcfH-qxXT4AYAqwr)Photo by [Jason\nLeung](https://unsplash.com/@ninjason?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)\non [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)\n\n* * *\n\nWhen first hearing about prompt engineering, many technical people (including\nmyself) tend to scoff at the idea. We might think, \u201c _Prompt engineering?\nPsssh, that\u2019s lame. Tell me how to build an LLM from scratch._ \u201d\n\nHowever, after diving into it more deeply, I\u2019d caution developers against\nwriting off prompt engineering automatically. I\u2019ll go even further and say\nthat **prompt engineering can realize 80% of the value** of most LLM use cases\nwith (relatively) very low effort.\n\nMy goal with this article is to convey this point via a practical review of\nprompt engineering and illustrative examples. While there are surely gaps in\nwhat prompt engineering can do, it opens the door to discovering simple and\nclever solutions to our problems.\n\nSupplemental Video.\n\n### **What is Prompt Engineering?**\n\nIn the [first article of this series](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-practical-introduction-to-llms-65194dda1148), I defined **prompt engineering** as **any use of an LLM\nout-of-the-box** (i.e. not training any internal model parameters). However,\nthere is much more that can be said about it.\n\n  1. Prompt Engineering is \u201c _the means by which LLMs are programmed with prompts._ \u201d [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382)]\n  2. Prompt Engineering is \u201ca _n empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a model\u2019s performance on a desired task._ \u201d [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)]\n  3. _\u201clanguage models\u2026 want to complete documents, and so you can trick them into performing tasks just by arranging fake documents_.\u201d [[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A)]\n\nThe first definition conveys the key innovation coming from LLMs, which is\nthat **computers can now be programmed using plain English**. The second point\nframes prompt engineering as a largely empirical endeavor, where\npractitioners, tinkerers, and builders are the key explorers of this new way\nof programming.\n\nThe third point (from [Andrej Karpathy](https://medium.com/u/ac9d9a35533e))\nreminds us that **LLMs aren\u2019t explicitly trained to do almost anything we ask\nthem to do**. Thus, in some sense, we are \u201ctricking\u201d these language models to\nsolve problems. I feel this captures the essence of prompt engineering, which\nrelies less on your technical skills and more on your creativity.\n\n### **2 Levels of Prompt Engineering**\n\nThere are two distinct ways in which one can do prompt engineering, which I\ncalled the \u201c**easy way** \u201d and the \u201c**less easy way** \u201d in the [first article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-practical-introduction-to-llms-65194dda1148) of this series.\n\n#### The Easy Way\n\nThis is how most of the world does prompt engineering, which is via ChatGPT\n(or something similar). It is an intuitive, no-code, and cost-free way to\ninteract with an LLM.\n\nWhile this is a great approach for something quick and simple, e.g.\nsummarizing a page of text, rewriting an email, helping you brainstorm\nbirthday party plans, etc., it has its downsides. A big one is that **it\u2019s not\neasy to integrate this approach into a larger automated process or software\nsystem**. To do this, we need to go one step further.\n\n#### The Less Easy Way\n\nThis resolves many of the drawbacks of the \u201ceasy way\u201d by interacting with LLMs\nprogrammatically i.e. using Python. We got a sense of how we can do this in\nthe previous two articles of this series, where explored [OpenAI\u2019s Python API](https://towardsdatascience.com/cracking-open-the-openai-python-api-230e4cae7971) and the [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://towardsdatascience.com/cracking-open-the-hugging-face-transformers-library-350aa0ef0161).\n\nWhile this requires more technical knowledge, **this is where the real power\nof prompt engineering lies** because it allows developers to integrate LLM-\nbased modules into larger software systems.\n\nA good (and perhaps ironic) example of this is ChatGPT. The core of this\nproduct is prompting a pre-trained model (i.e. GPT-3.5-turbo) to act like a\nchatbot and then wrapping it in an easy-to-use web interface.\n\nOf course, developing GPT-3.5-turbo is the hard part, **but that\u2019s not\nsomething we need to worry about here**. With all the pre-trained LLMs we have\nat our fingertips, almost anyone with basic programming skills can create a\npowerful AI application like ChatGPT without being an AI researcher or a\nmachine learning Ph.D.\n\n### **Building AI Apps with Prompt Engineering**\n\nThe less easy way unlocks a **new paradigm of programming and software\ndevelopment**. No longer are developers required to define every inch of logic\nin their software systems. They now have the option to offload a non-trivial\nportion to LLMs. Let\u2019s look at a concrete example of what this might look\nlike.\n\nSuppose you want to create an **automatic grader for a high school history\nclass**. The trouble, however, is that all the questions have written\nresponses, so there often can be multiple versions of a correct answer. For\nexample, the following responses to \u201c _Who was the 35th president of the\nUnited States of America?_ \u201d could be correct.\n\n  * John F. Kennedy\n  * JFK\n  * Jack Kennedy (a common nickname)\n  * John Fitzgerald Kennedy (probably trying to get extra credit)\n  * John F. Kenedy (misspelled last name)\n\nIn the **traditional programming paradigm** , it was on the developer to\nfigure out how to account for all these variations. To do this, they might\nlist all possible correct answers and use an exact string-matching algorithm\nor maybe even use fuzzy matching to help with misspelled words.\n\nHowever, with this new **LLM-enabled paradigm** , **the problem can be solved\nthrough simple prompt engineering**. For instance, we could use the following\nprompt to evaluate student answers.\n\n    \n    \n    You are a high school history teacher grading homework assignments. \\  \n    Based on the homework question indicated by \u201cQ:\u201d and the correct answer \\  \n    indicated by \u201cA:\u201d, your task is to determine whether the student's answer is \\  \n    correct.  \n    Grading is binary; therefore, student answers can be correct or wrong.  \n    Simple misspellings are okay.  \n       \n    Q: {question}  \n    A: {correct_answer}  \n       \n    Student Answer: {student_answer}\n\nWe can think of this prompt as a function, where given a **_question_** ,\n**_correct_answer_** , and **_student_answer_** , it generates the student's\ngrade. This can then be integrated into a larger piece of software that\nimplements the automatic grader.\n\nIn terms of time-saving, this prompt took me about 2 minutes to write, while\nif I were to try to develop an algorithm to do the same thing, it would take\nme hours (if not days) and probably have worse performance. **So the time\nsavings for tasks like this are 100\u20131000x**.\n\nOf course, there are many tasks in which LLMs do not provide any substantial\nbenefit, and other existing methods are much better suited (e.g. predicting\ntomorrow\u2019s weather). In no way are LLMs the solution to every problem, but\nthey do create a new set of solutions to tasks that require processing natural\nlanguage effectively\u2014something that has been historically difficult for\ncomputers to do.\n\n### **7 Tricks for Prompt Engineering**\n\nWhile the prompt example from before may seem like a natural and obvious way\nto frame the automatic grading task, it deliberately employed specific prompt\nengineering heuristics (or \u201ctricks,\u201d as I\u2019ll call them). These (and other)\ntricks have emerged as reliable ways to improve the quality of LLM responses.\n\nAlthough there are many tips and tricks for writing good prompts, here I\nrestrict the discussion to the ones that seem the most fundamental (IMO) based\non a handful of references [1,3\u20135]. For a deeper dive, I recommend the reader\nexplore the sources cited here.\n\n#### **Trick 1: Be Descriptive (More is Better)**\n\nA defining feature of LLMs is that they are trained on massive text corpora.\nThis equips them with a vast knowledge of the world and the ability to perform\nan enormous variety of tasks. However, this impressive generality may hinder\nperformance on a specific task if the proper context is not provided.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s compare two prompts for generating a birthday message for\nmy dad.\n\n**_Without Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Write me a birthday message for my dad.\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Write me a birthday message for my dad no longer than 200 \\  \n    characters. This is a big birthday because he is turning 50. To celebrate, \\  \n    I booked us a boys' trip to Cancun. Be sure to include some cheeky humor, he \\  \n    loves that.\n\n#### **Trick 2: Give Examples**\n\nThe next trick is to give the LLM example responses to improve its performance\non a particular task. The technical term for this is **few-shot learning,**\nand has been shown to improve LLM performance significantly [6].\n\nLet\u2019s look at a specific example. Say we want to write a subtitle for a\nTowards Data Science article. We can use existing examples to help guide the\nLLM completion.\n\n**_Without Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Given the title of a Towards Data Science blog article, write a subtitle for it.  \n      \n    Title: Prompt Engineering\u2014How to trick AI into solving your problems  \n    Subtitle:\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Given the title of a Towards Data Science blog article, write a subtitle for it.  \n      \n    Title: A Practical Introduction to LLMs  \n    Subtitle: 3 levels of using LLMs in practice  \n      \n    Title: Cracking Open the OpenAI (Python) API  \n    Subtitle: A complete beginner-friendly introduction with example code  \n      \n    Title: Prompt Engineering-How to trick AI into solving your problems  \n    Subtitle:\n\n#### **Trick 3: Use Structured Text**\n\nEnsuring prompts follow an organized structure not only makes them easier to\nread and write, but also tends to help the model generate good completions. We\nemployed this technique in the example for **Trick 2** , where we explicitly\nlabeled the _title_ and _subtitle_ for each example.\n\nHowever, there are countless ways we can give our prompts structure. Here are\na handful of examples: use ALL CAPS for emphasis, use delimiters like ``` to\nhighlight a body of text, use markup languages like Markdown or HTML to format\ntext, use JSON to organize information, etc.  \n  \nNow, let\u2019s see this in action.\n\n**_Without Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Write me a recipe for chocolate chip cookies.\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Create a well-organized recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Use the following \\  \n    formatting elements:  \n      \n    **Title**: Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies  \n    **Ingredients**: List the ingredients with precise measurements and formatting.  \n    **Instructions**: Provide step-by-step instructions in numbered format, detailing the baking process.  \n    **Tips**: Include a separate section with helpful baking tips and possible variations.\n\n#### **Trick 4: Chain of Thought**\n\nThis trick was proposed by Wei et al. [7]. The basic idea is to guide an LLM\nto think \u201cstep by step\u201d. This helps break down complex problems into\nmanageable sub-problems, which gives the LLM \u201ctime to think\u201d [3,5]. Zhang et\nal. showed that this could be as simple as including the text \u201c _Let\u2019s think\nstep by step_ \u201d in the prompt [8].\n\nThis notion can be extended to any recipe-like process. For example, if I want\nto create a LinkedIn post based on my latest Medium blog, I can guide the LLM\nto mirror the step-by-step process I follow.\n\n**_Without Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Write me a LinkedIn post based on the following Medium blog.  \n      \n    Medium blog: {Medium blog text}\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Write me a LinkedIn post based on the step-by-step process and Medium blog \\  \n    given below.    \n      \n    Step 1: Come up with a one line hook relevant to the blog.   \n    Step 2: Extract 3 key points from the article   \n    Step 3: Compress each point to less than 50 characters.   \n    Step 4: Combine the hook, compressed key points from Step 3, and a call to action \\  \n    to generate the final output.  \n      \n    Medium blog: {Medium blog text}\n\n#### **Trick 5: Chatbot Personas**\n\nA somewhat surprising technique that tends to improve LLM performance is to\nprompt it to take on a particular persona e.g. \u201c _you are an expert_ \u201d. This\nis helpful because you may not know the best way to describe your problem to\nthe LLM, but you may know who would help you solve that problem\n[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382)]. Here\u2019s what this might look like in\npractice.\n\n**_Without Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Make me a travel itinerary for a weekend in New York City.\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Act as an NYC native and cabbie who knows everything about the city. \\  \n    Please make me a travel itinerary for a weekend in New York City based on \\  \n    your experience. Don't forget to include your charming NY accent in your \\  \n    response.\n\n#### **Trick 6: Flipped Approach**\n\nIt can be difficult to optimally prompt an LLM when **we do not know what it\nknows or how it thinks**. That is where the \u201cflipped approach\u201d can be helpful.\nThis is where you prompt the LLM to ask you questions until it has a\nsufficient understanding (i.e. context) of the problem you are trying to\nsolve.\n\n**_Without Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     What is an idea for an LLM-based application?\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     I want you to ask me questions to help me come up with an LLM-based \\  \n    application idea. Ask me one question at a time to keep things conversational.\n\n#### **Trick 7: Reflect, Review, and Refine**\n\nThis final trick prompts the model to reflect on its past responses to improve\nthem. Common use cases are having the model critically evaluate its own work\nby asking it if it \u201c _completed the assignment_ \u201d or having it \u201c _explain the\nreasoning and assumptions_ \u201d behind a response [1, 3].\n\nAdditionally, you can ask the LLM to refine not only its responses but **your\nprompts**. This is a simple way to automatically rewrite prompts so that they\nare easier for the model to \u201cunderstand\u201d.\n\n**_With Trick_**\n\n    \n    \n     Review your previous response, pinpoint areas for enhancement, and offer an \\  \n    improved version. Then explain your reasoning for how you improved the response.\n\n### **Example Code: Automatic Grader with LangChain**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve reviewed several prompting heuristics let\u2019s see how we can\napply them to a specific use case. To do this, we will return to the automatic\ngrader example from before.\n\n    \n    \n    You are a high school history teacher grading homework assignments. \\  \n    Based on the homework question indicated by \"Q:\" and the correct answer \\  \n    indicated by \"A:\", your task is to determine whether the student's answer is \\  \n    correct.  \n    Grading is binary; therefore, student answers can be correct or wrong.  \n    Simple misspellings are okay.  \n       \n    Q: {question}  \n    A: {correct_answer}  \n       \n    Student Answer: {student_answer}\n\nOn second look, a few of the previously mentioned tricks should be apparent\ni.e. **Trick 6** : chatbot persona, **Trick 3** : use structured text, and\n**Trick 1** : be descriptive. This is what good prompting typically looks like\nin practice, namely combining multiple techniques in a single prompt.\n\nWhile we could copy-paste this prompt template into ChatGPT and replace the\n_question_ , _correct_answer_ , and _student_answer_ fields, **this is not a\nscalable way to implement the automatic grader**. Rather, what we want is to\nintegrate this prompt into a larger software system so that we can build a\nuser-friendly application that a human can use.\n\n#### LangChain\n\nOne way we can do this is via **LangChain** , which is **a Python library that\nhelps simplify building applications on top of large language models**. It\ndoes this by providing a variety of handy abstractions for using LLMs\nprogrammatically.\n\nThe central class that does this is called **chain** (hence the library name).\nThis abstracts the process of generating a prompt, sending it to an LLM, and\nparsing the output so that it can be easily called and integrated into a\nlarger script.\n\nLet\u2019s see how to use LangChain for our automatic grader use case. The example\ncode is available on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShawhinT/YouTube-Blog/tree/main/LLMs/langchain-example) for this article.\n\n#### Imports\n\nWe first start by importing the necessary library modules.\n\n    \n    \n    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI  \n    from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate  \n    from langchain.chains import LLMChain  \n    from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser\n\nHere we will use gpt-3.5-turbo which requires a secret key for OpenAI\u2019s API.\nIf you don\u2019t have one, I gave a step-by-step guide on how to get one in a\n[past article](https://towardsdatascience.com/cracking-open-the-openai-python-api-230e4cae7971) of this series. I like to store the secret key in a separate\nPython file (_sk.py_) and import it with the following line of code.\n\n    \n    \n    from sk import my_sk #importing secret key from another python file\n\n#### Our 1st chain\n\nTo define our chain, we need two core elements: the **LLM** and the\n**prompt**. We start by creating an object for the LLM.\n\n    \n    \n    # define LLM object  \n    chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=my_sk, temperature=0)\n\nLangChain has a class specifically for OpenAI (and many other) chat models. I\npass in my secret API key and set the temperature to 0. The default model here\nis _gpt-3.5-turbo_ , but you can alternatively use _gpt-4_ using the\n\u201cmodel_name\u201d input argument. You can further customize the chat model by\nsetting other [input arguments](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.html#langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI).\n\nNext, we define our **prompt template**. This object allows us to generate\nprompts dynamically via input strings that automatically update a base\ntemplate. Here\u2019s what that looks like.\n\n    \n    \n    # define prompt template  \n    prompt_template_text = \"\"\"You are a high school history teacher grading \\  \n    homework assignments. Based on the homework question indicated by \u201c**Q:**\u201d \\  \n    and the correct answer indicated by \u201c**A:**\u201d, your task is to determine \\  \n    whether the student's answer is correct. Grading is binary; therefore, \\  \n    student answers can be correct or wrong. Simple misspellings are okay.  \n      \n    **Q:** {question}  \n    **A:** {correct_answer}  \n      \n    **Student's Answer:** {student_answer}  \n    \"\"\"  \n      \n    prompt = PromptTemplate(  \n                input_variables=[\"question\", \"correct_answer\", \"student_answer\"], \\  \n                template = prompt_template_text)\n\nWith our LLM and prompt, we can now define our chain.\n\n    \n    \n    # define chain  \n    chain = LLMChain(llm=chat_model, prompt=prompt)\n\nNext, we can pass inputs to the chain and obtain a grade in one line of code.\n\n    \n    \n    # define inputs  \n    question = \"Who was the 35th president of the United States of America?\"  \n    correct_answer = \"John F. Kennedy\"  \n    student_answer =  \"FDR\"  \n      \n    # run chain  \n    chain.run({'question':question, 'correct_answer':correct_answer, \\  \n        'student_answer':student_answer})  \n      \n    # output: Student's Answer is wrong. \n\nWhile this chain can perform the grading task effectively, its outputs may not\nbe suitable for an automated process. For instance, in the above code block,\nthe LLM correctly said the student\u2019s answer of \u201cFDR\u201d was wrong, but it would\nbe better if the LLM gave us an output in a standard format that could be used\nin downstream processing.\n\n#### Output parser\n\nThis is where **output parsers** come in handy. These are functions we can\nintegrate into a chain to convert LLM outputs to a standard format. Let\u2019s see\nhow we can make an output parser that converts the LLM response to a boolean\n(i.e. _True_ or _False_) output.\n\n    \n    \n    # define output parser  \n    class GradeOutputParser(BaseOutputParser):  \n        \"\"\"Determine whether grade was correct or wrong\"\"\"  \n      \n        def parse(self, text: str):  \n            \"\"\"Parse the output of an LLM call.\"\"\"  \n            return \"wrong\" not in text.lower()\n\nHere, we create a simple output parser that checks if the word \u201cwrong\u201d is in\nthe LLM\u2019s output. If not, we return _True_ , indicating the student's correct\nanswer. Otherwise, we return _False_ , indicating the student's answer was\nincorrect.\n\nWe can then incorporate this output parser into our chain to seamlessly parse\ntext when we run the chain.\n\n    \n    \n    # update chain  \n    chain = LLMChain(  \n        llm=chat_model,  \n        prompt=prompt,  \n        output_parser=GradeOutputParser()  \n    )\n\nFinally, we can run the chain for a whole list of student answers and print\nthe outputs.\n\n    \n    \n    # run chain in for loop  \n    student_answer_list = [\"John F. Kennedy\", \"JFK\", \"FDR\", \"John F. Kenedy\", \\  \n                      \"John Kennedy\", \"Jack Kennedy\", \"Jacquelin Kennedy\", \\  \n                      \"Robert F. Kenedy\"]  \n      \n    for student_answer in student_answer_list:  \n        print(student_answer + \" - \" +   \n          str(chain.run({'question':question, 'correct_answer':correct_answer, \\  \n                        'student_answer':student_answer})))  \n        print('\\n')  \n      \n    # Output:  \n    # John F. Kennedy - True  \n    # JFK - True  \n    # FDR - False  \n    # John F. Kenedy - True  \n    # John Kennedy - True  \n    # Jack Kennedy - True  \n    # Jacqueline Kennedy - False  \n    # Robert F. Kenedy - False\n\n### Limitations\n\nPrompt Engineering is more than asking ChatGPT for help writing an email or\nlearning about Quantum Computing. It is a **_new programming paradigm that\nchanges how developers can build applications_**.\n\nWhile this is a powerful innovation, it has its limitations. For one, optimal\nprompting strategies are LLM-dependent. For example, prompting GPT-3 to \u201cthink\nstep-by-step\u201d resulted in significant performance gains on simple mathematical\nreasoning tasks [8]. However, for the latest version of ChatGPT, the same\nstrategy doesn\u2019t seem helpful (it already thinks step-by-step).\n\nAnother limitation of Prompt Engineering is it requires large-scale general-\npurpose language models such as ChatGPT, which come at significant\ncomputational and financial costs. This may be overkill for many use cases\nthat are more narrowly defined e.g. string matching, sentiment analysis, or\ntext summarization.\n\nWe can overcome both these limitations via **fine-tuning** pre-trained\nlanguage models. This is where we **take an existing language model and tweak\nit for a particular use case.** In the [next article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/fine-tuning-large-language-models-llms-23473d763b91) of this series, we will explore popular fine-tuning\ntechniques supplemented with example Python code.\n</option_1>\n\n<option_2>\n# Unlocking the Power of Prompt Engineering: A Practical Guide\n\n### Transforming How We Interact with AI\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, the concept of prompt engineering has emerged as a pivotal skill for developers and data scientists alike. But what is prompt engineering, and why should you care? If you've ever found yourself frustrated with the limitations of AI models or wondered how to get the most out of them, you're in the right place. This article will demystify prompt engineering, providing you with actionable insights and practical examples to harness this powerful technique.\n\nPrompt engineering is not just a buzzword; it's a new way to communicate with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and beyond. Instead of traditional programming, where you write explicit instructions, prompt engineering allows you to interact with AI using natural language. This shift is akin to teaching a computer to understand your requests rather than simply following commands. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll see how this approach can revolutionize your workflow and enhance your AI applications.\n\n![AI Interaction](https://example.com/image.jpg)Image attribution\n\n* * *\n\n### What is Prompt Engineering?\n\nAt its core, prompt engineering is the art of crafting inputs that guide LLMs to produce desired outputs. Think of it as a conversation where the quality of your questions determines the depth of the answers you receive. As highlighted in various research papers, including one by White et al., prompt engineering can be viewed as a new form of programming, where prompts become the commands that direct the model's behavior.\n\nBut don\u2019t be fooled into thinking it\u2019s a purely scientific endeavor. Prompt engineering is more of an empirical art, as described by researchers like Hugh et al. It involves a lot of trial and error, experimenting with different phrasing and structures to see what yields the best results. This process can feel chaotic at times, but it\u2019s through this exploration that effective techniques begin to emerge.\n\n### The Two Levels of Prompt Engineering\n\nWhen it comes to prompt engineering, there are two distinct approaches: the **easy way** and the **less easy way**. \n\n- **The Easy Way**: This includes user-friendly interfaces like ChatGPT and Bing Chat, which allow anyone to interact with LLMs without needing to write code. While this is a great starting point, it can be limiting when you want to build more complex applications.\n  \n- **The Less Easy Way**: This involves programmatically interacting with LLMs using languages like Python or JavaScript. This method offers greater flexibility and customization, enabling developers to integrate AI capabilities into larger software systems.\n\n* * *\n\n### Building AI Applications with Prompt Engineering\n\nImagine you\u2019re tasked with creating an automatic grader for a high school history class. This may seem straightforward for multiple-choice questions, but what about short or long-form answers? \n\nFor example, if the question is, \u201cWho was the 35th president of the United States?\u201d there are various acceptable answers: John F. Kennedy, JFK, or even Jack Kennedy. Traditionally, programming this logic would require extensive coding to handle all possible variations. However, with prompt engineering, you can simplify this process dramatically.\n\nInstead of crafting complex algorithms, you can use a straightforward prompt like this:\n\n```\nYou are a high school history teacher grading homework assignments based on the homework question indicated by Q and the correct answer indicated by A. Your task is to determine whether the student's answer is correct. Grading is binary; therefore, student answers can be correct or wrong. Simple misspellings are okay.\n```\n\nThis prompt can be fed to an LLM, and it will provide a response indicating whether the student's answer is correct, saving you hours of coding time.\n\n### Seven Tricks for Effective Prompt Engineering\n\nTo enhance your prompt engineering skills, consider these seven tricks:\n\n1. **Be Descriptive**: Unlike traditional writing where brevity is key, in prompt engineering, more context often leads to better results. \n\n2. **Give Examples**: Incorporating few-shot learning by providing examples can significantly improve the model's performance.\n\n3. **Use Structured Text**: Organizing your prompts with clear formatting can help the model understand the desired output better.\n\n4. **Chain of Thought**: Encourage the model to think step-by-step, breaking down complex tasks into manageable parts.\n\n5. **Chatbot Personas**: Assigning a persona to the model can yield responses that are more tailored and engaging.\n\n6. **The Flipped Approach**: Instead of asking the model for answers, prompt it to ask you questions to better understand your needs.\n\n7. **Reflect, Review, and Refine**: Encourage the model to evaluate its previous responses for improvements or corrections.\n\n* * *\n\n### A Practical Example: Automatic Grading\n\nLet\u2019s walk through a practical example of using prompt engineering in Python with the LangChain library to create an automatic grading system. \n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nfrom langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate\n\n# Define the prompt template\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\"You are a high school history teacher grading homework assignments based on the homework question indicated by Q and the correct answer indicated by A. Your task is to determine whether the student's answer is correct. Grading is binary; therefore, student answers can be correct or wrong. Simple misspellings are okay.\")\n\n# Build the LLM chain\nchain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY'), prompt=prompt)\n\n# Define inputs\ninputs = {\n    \"Q\": \"Who was the 35th President of the United States?\",\n    \"A\": \"John F. Kennedy\",\n    \"student_answer\": \"JFK\"\n}\n\n# Run the chain\nresult = chain.run(inputs)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a prompt template that instructs the model on how to evaluate student answers. By simply adjusting the inputs, we can easily assess various student responses with minimal coding.\n\n### Conclusion: Embrace the Future of AI Interaction\n\nPrompt engineering is not just a trend; it\u2019s a fundamental shift in how we interact with artificial intelligence. By mastering the art of crafting effective prompts, you can save time, enhance productivity, and unlock new possibilities in your AI projects.\n\nAs you explore the world of prompt engineering, remember that practice makes perfect. Experiment with different techniques, learn from your results, and don\u2019t hesitate to share your findings with the community. The future of AI is bright, and with the right tools, you can be at the forefront of this exciting journey.\n\n* * *\n\nReady to dive deeper into prompt engineering?
