# How Iâ€™d Learn AI in 2025 (If I Could Start Over)

## A 5-step roadmap for todayâ€™s landscape

Today, more people than ever are trying to learn AI. Although there are countless free learning resources online, navigating this rapidly evolving landscape can be overwhelming (especially as a beginner). In this article, I discuss how Iâ€™d approach learning AI, given what I know now and the tools available today.

## Who is this for?

Given the wide range of backgrounds interested in AI these days, Iâ€™ve tried to make this guide widely accessible. However, no guide can help everyone. Here are a few specific groups I have in mind:

- **Technical professionals** trying to up-skill for career advancement
- **Business leaders** who havenâ€™t coded in years, trying to keep up with the changing tech landscape
- **Entrepreneurs** building AI-native products
- **Students** trying to develop their technical AI skills

**About me** â€” Iâ€™ve worked in AI for the past 6 years. I started as an AI researcher while getting my PhD, then eventually worked as a data scientist at Toyota. Although I still have a lot to learn, the approach below covers (what I think are) the essentials based on my personal experience.

## My 5-Step Approach

The guiding principle of this framework is to **learn by doing**. Each step outlines a clear and specific objective through which completion will naturally develop key skills. In other words, rather than reviewing a list of concepts and courses, **each step is a task** designed to force me to learn essential skills by completing it.

Hereâ€™s an overview of the 5-step approach. Each step builds upon the ones before it:

1. Use ChatGPT (or the like)
2. Install Python
3. Build an Automation
4. Build an ML Project
5. Build a Real-world Project

## Step 1: Use ChatGPT (or the like)

If starting from zero, the first thing I would do is familiarize myself with modern AI tools i.e. ChatGPT, Claude, and the like. This is important because frequently using these models will give me a **practical understanding of what they can and canâ€™t do** and develop my ability to **use them effectively through prompting**.

On a more meta level, these chat interfaces are incredible tools for learning AI (or anything else, really). Iâ€™d use it to explain confusing buzzwords and technical concepts (e.g. LLM, tokens, API, RAG) and be sure to **ask follow-up questions** until I have a solid understanding of each idea. For those that donâ€™t click, Iâ€™d seek alternative resources using Google search and YouTube.

- **Task**: Pick an AI chat tool and use it in daily work
- **Resources**: 
  - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
  - [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
  - [Together AI](https://api.together.ai/playground/chat/)
  - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
  - [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

## Step 2: Install Python

Although I could go far with todayâ€™s no-code AI tools, they are fundamentally limited. Namely, these tools **canâ€™t be easily used to build custom solutions** or process information in bulk. Thatâ€™s why the next thing I would do is install Python on my computer.

**Python is the industry standard programming language for AI development**. To get it installed, Iâ€™d ask ChatGPT for step-by-step instructions. If I get stuck, Iâ€™d come back to ChatGPT, explain the issue, and ask for additional guidance.

- **Task**: Install Python on your machine

## Step 3: Build an Automation (Beginner)

Once Iâ€™ve become comfortable using ChatGPT and installed Python on my machine, my next step would be to build a simple automation using Python. My approach to generating project ideas would be to **think of things I consistently use ChatGPT for** (e.g. summarizing research articles), then try and automate it with Python.

This would require me to become familiar with OpenAIâ€™s Python API. So, Iâ€™d start by reading their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and reviewing the example code there.

### Example Automation: Paper Summarizer
Steps:
1. Read paper contents into Python
2. Construct prompt for GPT-4o
3. Make an OpenAI API call

- **Task**: Use OpenAI API (or the like) to build a simple automation

  - [Paper Summarizer Example](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-quickstart-for-people-learning-ai-58a1b76df0f4#4117)

---

## Step 4: Build an ML Project (Intermediate)

After Step 3 gets easy for me, Iâ€™d seek out more sophisticated projects. Rather than simply making ChatGPT-like API calls, Iâ€™d build a project that required me to **use embedding models or to train a model myself**.

### Potential Project Ideas:
- [Semantic search tool](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-embeddings-classification-and-semantic-search-8291746220be)
- [Basic RAG system](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-improve-llms-with-rag-abdc132f76ac) (i.e. semantic search + LLM)
- [Clustering documents based on similarity](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-embeddings-classification-and-semantic-search-8291746220be)
- [Training a text classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-bert-for-text-classification-a01f89b179fc)

- **Task**: Build an ML project that goes beyond ChatGPT-like API calls

## Step 5: Build a Real-world Project (Advanced)

At this point, Iâ€™d need to use what I learned to solve real-world problems. Here are a **few different ways Iâ€™d approach this**:

1. Reach out to business owners and professionals in my network
2. Join a research group at my University (if I was a student)
3. Find an internship (if I was a student)
4. Find a freelance gig on Upwork
