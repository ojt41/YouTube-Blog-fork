# How to Freelance as a Data Scientist
#### Asking successful freelancers how they do it

Freelancing (in data science) offers incredible flexibility, autonomy, and
high earning potential. But starting can be daunting, especially if
transitioning from a traditional job or new to the field.

Last year, I sat down with three seasoned freelancers — [Nick Gallo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-gallo-67548944/), [Matteo Hoch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteohoch/), and [Dimitri Visnadi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/visnadi/)— who, between them, have made millions
of dollars freelancing over the past few years. Here, I recap the key insights
from the [conversation](https://youtu.be/VKLLyv9cJSQ).

### Is Freelancing a Fad or the Future?

The rise of “work from home” and the “gig economy” led many individuals and
companies to explore alternative working methods. However, _is this a fad or a
fundamental shift?_

The **panelists said freelancing is here to stay** , driven by two main
forces:

  1. **Flexibility for Startups** : Startups and small businesses often can’t afford full-time data scientists but still need data expertise. Freelancers offer a flexible solution, allowing them to scale resources as needed.
  2. **Autonomy for Professionals** : Freelancing allows data professionals to work on varied projects, enjoy flexible hours, and control their work environment. This autonomy is highly appealing, especially in a world increasingly open to remote work.

Nick also highlighted how freelancing has allowed him to pick projects that
**align with his interests** and even **scale down to part-time work when
needed** , enabling him to focus on personal projects.

### Understanding Client Needs

A key challenge for freelancers (especially when getting started) is **clearly
defining the project scope.** Clients may not fully understand how data
science can be used to solve their problems effectively. How you navigate this
will determine your success as a freelancer.

Here’s how the panelists handle this:

  * **Listen and Guide** : Dimitri mentioned that many clients might have vague ideas, often influenced by buzzwords like “AI” or “machine learning.” The job of a freelancer is to peel back the layers and help them understand their true needs.
  * **Showcase Expertise Early** : Matteo emphasized using the discovery stage to showcase expertise, often by providing specific insights. This helps build credibility and shifts the client’s mindset from “ _hiring a coder_ ” to “ _hiring a problem-solver._ ”
  * **Offer Flexibility** : Nick pointed out that most of his larger contracts started as small projects. Clients gradually increased the scope and hours as he delivered value and built trust. This approach allows you to demonstrate your value without overwhelming the client from the start.

Even if a project starts on the right foot, there are still several
opportunities for **misalignment over a project engagement**. The panelists
shared the following tips for avoiding this.

  * **Be the Project Manager** : As a freelancer, you’re not just the data scientist — you’re also the project manager. Establish clear expectations, deliverables, and timelines upfront.
  * **Regular Updates** : Nick found success by sending weekly video updates to his clients, showcasing progress and explaining any challenges faced. This builds transparency and trust.

### How To Get Clients

While there are many similarities between the work you do as a data scientist
as a full-time employee and freelancer, a key difference is the need to
**attract and close new contracts consistently**.

Here’s how the panelists have successfully done it:

  * **Leverage Platforms Like Upwork** : For beginners, Upwork is a great place to start. Getting your first 5–6 reviews will help establish credibility, making it easier to land more clients.
  * **Word of Mouth and Referrals** : Dimitri highlighted the importance of building strong relationships with past clients. Sending regular updates, holiday cards, or checking in occasionally can lead to repeat business or referrals.
  * **Content Creation** : I mentioned that creating YouTube videos and writing Medium articles have significantly driven my inbound leads. Although it takes time to build, content marketing can generate a consistent stream of potential clients.

**_Key Takeaway_** _: Diversify your lead generation methods. While platforms
like Upwork can provide quick wins, building your brand through content
creation and networking will yield long-term success._

### Finding Your Niche

The panelists stressed the importance of finding a niche in the data science
freelancing. The two key benefits mentioned for niching are as follows.

  1. **Differentiation** : Focusing on a specific domain (e.g., marketing analytics or financial data science) helps you stand out and command higher rates.
  2. **Build Expertise Faster** : When you specialize, you develop a deeper understanding of the problems and tools in that niche, making you more efficient and effective.

### Building a Long-Term Freelance Career

Freelancing isn’t just about the hamster wheel of finding the next gig but
building a sustainable career. Here are the panelists' long-term outlooks.

  * **Develop Small Teams** : Nick shared his goal of transitioning into building small teams to tackle larger projects. This strategy not only adds more value to clients but also allows you to scale beyond the limitations of a solo freelancer.
  * **Content and Referrals** : Matteo and Dimitri emphasized that inbound leads often come from building relationships, word-of-mouth, or sharing knowledge through content like articles or YouTube videos. These efforts may take time to pay off, but they help establish credibility and bring in clients who are already warmed up to your expertise.

### Key Takeaways

Freelancing in data science is not a fad — it’s a viable career path offering
flexibility, diversity of work, and the opportunity to shape your destiny.
However, success requires **more than just technical skills**. You’ll need to
be proactive in client communication, building relationships, and continuously
refining your expertise.

If you’re just starting or considering this path, here are **three takeaways**
from this conversation.

  1. Focus on building a solid foundation of skills and reviews.
  2. Be proactive in understanding client needs and defining clear scopes.
  3. Stay motivated by keeping your long-term goals in mind and connecting with other data freelancers.
