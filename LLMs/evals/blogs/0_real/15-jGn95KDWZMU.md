Despite all the math and programming, data science is more than just analyzing
data and building models. When you boil it down, the key objective of data
science is to **solve problems**.

The trouble, however, is that at the outset of most data science projects, we
rarely have a well-defined problem. In these situations, the role of the data
scientist isn‚Äôt to have all the answers but to **ask the right questions**.

In this article, I‚Äôll break down 5 questions every data scientist should
hardcode into their brain to make problem discovery second nature.

### **Hammer time**

When I began my data science journey in grad school, I had a naive view of the
discipline. Namely, I was hyper-focused on learning tools and technologies
(e.g. LSTM, SHAP, VAE, SOM, SQL, etc.)

While a technical foundation is necessary to be a successful data scientist,
focusing too much on tools creates the ‚ÄúHammer Problem‚Äù (i.e. when you have a
really nice hammer, everything looks like a nail).

This often leads to projects which are **intellectually stimulating yet
practically useless**.

### **Problems > Tech**

My perspective didn‚Äôt fully mature until I graduated and joined the data
science team at a large enterprise, where I was able to learn from those years
(if not decades) ahead of me.

The key lesson was the importance of **focusing on problems rather than
technologies**. What this means is gaining a (sufficiently) deep understanding
of the business problem before writing a single line of code.

Since, as data scientists, we typically don‚Äôt solve our own problems, we gain
this understanding through conversations with clients and stakeholders.
Getting this right is important because, if you don‚Äôt, you can end up spending
a lot of time (and money) **solving the wrong problem**. This is where
‚Äúproblem discovery‚Äù questions come in.

### **5 Problem Discovery Questions**

6 months ago, [I left my corporate data science job](https://medium.com/the-data-entrepreneurs/why-i-left-a-150-000-yr-data-science-job-to-become-an-entrepreneur-64ea530e6ef1) to become an independent data science consultant
(to fund my entrepreneurial ventures). Since then, I‚Äôve developed an obsession
with cracking these early-stage ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù conversations.

My approach to getting better at this has been twofold. **First** , interview
seasoned data freelancers about their best practices (I talked to 10).
**Second** , do as many discovery calls as possible (I did about 25).

The questions listed here are the culmination of all my previously mentioned
experiences. While it‚Äôs by no means a complete list, these are questions I
find myself asking over and over again.

#### **1) What problem are you trying to solve?**

While (in theory) this should be the only question on this list, that
(unfortunately) is not how things work out in practice. Many times, clients
aren‚Äôt clear on the problem they need to solve (if they were, they probably
wouldn‚Äôt be talking to a consultant). And even if they are, I usually need to
catch up to understand the business context better.

This question helps in both cases because (ideally) the client‚Äôs answer
prompts follow-up questions, allowing me to **dig deeper into their world**.
For instance, they might say, ‚Äú _We tried creating a custom chatbot with
OpenAI, but it didn‚Äôt provide good results_.‚Äù

To which I might ask, ‚Äú _What was the chatbot used for?_ ‚Äù or ‚Äú _What makes
you say the results weren‚Äôt good?_ ‚Äù.

#### **2) Why‚Ä¶?**

A natural follow-up question to ‚Äú _what_ ‚Äù is ‚Äú _why_.‚Äù This is one of the
most powerful questions you can ask a client. However, it can also be **one of
the most difficult to ask**.

‚Äú _Why_ ‚Äù questions have a tendency to make people defensive, which is why
having multiple ways of phrasing this question can be helpful. Here are a few
examples:

  * _Why is this important to your business (your team)?_
  * _Why do you want to solve this now?_
  * _What does solving this mean for your business?_
  * _How does this fit into the larger goals of the business?_
  * _Why do you want to use AI to solve this problem?_

This question (or any of its variants) is an extremely effective way to get
context from the client, which should (again) spark follow-up questions.

To continue the example from before, the client might say, ‚Äú _We have several
support tickets that we want to categorize into 3 levels of prioritization
automatically, and we thought an AI chatbot was a good way to solve that
problem._ ‚Äù This gives much more context to the ‚Äú _We tried making a custom
chatbot_ ‚Äù response from before.

‚Äú _What are we doing?_ ‚Äù and ‚Äú _Why are we doing it?_ ‚Äù __ are the two most
fundamental questions in business. So, getting good at asking ‚Äú _what_ ‚Äù and ‚Äú
_why_ ‚Äù can take you (very) far.

#### **3) What‚Äôs your dream outcome?**

I like this question because it (effectively) combines the ‚Äú _what_ ‚Äù and ‚Äú
_why_ ‚Äù questions. This allows clients to speak to their vision for the
project in a way that may not come through when asked directly.

To learn something new, I often need to take a few passes before it finally
clicks. Similarly, I find that to _really_ get to the root of a client‚Äôs
problem, I need to ask ‚Äú _what_ ‚Äù and ‚Äú _why_ ‚Äù**a few times in different
ways** throughout the conversation.

This is reminiscent of **Toyota‚Äôs ‚Äú5 Why‚Äôs‚Äù** approach to getting to the root
cause of a problem. While this was developed in a manufacturing context, this
is something that readily applies to problem-solving in data science.

Two related questions here are: _What does success look like?_ and _How would
we measure it?_ These are a bit more pragmatic than a ‚Äúdream outcome‚Äù but are
helpful for transitioning from asking ‚Äú _what and why_ ‚Äù to ‚Äú _how?_ ‚Äù

#### **4) What have you tried so far?**

This question starts on the path toward a solution. It does this by bringing
out more of the project's technical details.

For instance, this (typically) gives me a good idea of who will be writing the
code. If they‚Äôve already built some basic POCs, then the client (and their
team) will probably be doing most of the heavy lifting. If they are starting
from scratch, it might be me or sub-contractors from my network.

In this 2nd scenario, where the **client has built nothing** so far, one can
ask a few other questions.

  * _What is the existing solution?_
  * _How do you solve this problem now?_
  * _What have others done to solve a similar problem?_

#### **5) Why me?**

I got this question from master negotiator [Chris Voss](https://www.blackswanltd.com/chris-voss). Who frames it as an effective
way to reveal people‚Äôs motivations.

Often, this sparks additional context about what led them to you and **how
they** **see you fitting into the project** , which is helpful in defining the
next steps.

Sometimes, however, people don‚Äôt have good answers to this question, which may
indicate that they don‚Äôt actually want to work with you and are holding back
their true intentions (e.g. they want free consulting or a competing bid).

### **A Key Lesson**

A key lesson for me these past months was to **learn these questions**(i.e.
_hardcode_ them into my brain)**but then forget about them**.

The goal is to get to where these questions naturally form in your mind in the
flow of conversation. While this requires a fair share of awkward moments,
it‚Äôs something that can only develop through practice (_don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm still
practicing too_).

What has helped me is going into these conversations with the goal of
learning. This means **being curious** , **asking questions** , and
**listening** (much) more than talking.

### Conclusion

While technical skills are required to do data science, without a clear
understanding of the problem, these skills cannot provide much value. This is
why developing the communication skills necessary for effectively identifying
and understanding a client‚Äôs business problem is essential.

Here, I shared 5 fundamental questions for problem discovery. While this isn‚Äôt
a complete list, I hope it is helpful to data folks taking on more client-
facing roles.
