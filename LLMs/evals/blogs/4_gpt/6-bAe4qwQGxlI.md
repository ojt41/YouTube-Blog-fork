# Build a Web App in 4 Days

### How I Transformed YouTube Videos into Blog Posts

In today's fast-paced digital world, the ability to quickly turn ideas into functional applications can set you apart. I recently embarked on a journey to build a web app that translates YouTube videos into blog posts, and astonishingly, I accomplished this in just four days. With no prior web development experience, I relied on a blend of problem-solving, design intuition, and modern coding tools. This article outlines my step-by-step process, the challenges I faced, and the tools that made it possible.

### The Journey Begins

As someone with a background in data science, I was familiar with programming but had never ventured into consumer software development. This is a common hurdle for many data scientists: proficient in Python but lacking the skills to ship software products. With my savings dwindling, I set an ambitious goal for myself: to launch one product each month until I found something that generated revenue.

After spending some time on Indie Hacker Twitter, I realized that the best way to learn was through hands-on experience. I brainstormed several product ideas, including a YouTube thumbnail generator and a YouTube clip finder, but ultimately settled on a YouTube video-to-blog converter. This idea not only resonated with my skills but also had market demand, as evidenced by job postings on platforms like Upwork.

### Designing the User Experience

**What’s the first step when you can’t code? Design.** 

On day one, I focused on crafting a brand blueprint. This included selecting a color palette, fonts, and designing a logo. Using a tool called Cooler, I quickly found a color scheme that appealed to me and pulled everything together in Canva. By the end of the day, I had a clear design layout that would guide the development process.

### Front-End Development

**How do you code without knowing HTML? Use what you know.**

Day two was all about implementing the front end based on my Canva design. I opted to use Python, leveraging a newly released library called Fast HTML, which allows developers to build web apps using Python. After a morning of learning through lectures and documentation, I began coding the front end. 

To kickstart my coding, I took a screenshot of my Canva design and used a tool called Cursor to help translate that design into code. I supplemented this with ChatGPT for CSS styling, creating a workflow that blended AI assistance with my coding efforts. By the end of day two, I had a front-end that closely matched my initial vision.

### Backend Implementation

**What’s the app without functionality? Just a pretty face.**

By day three, I had a functioning front end, but it didn’t do anything yet. The next step was to implement the backend. I turned to ChatGPT to help craft prompts for generating blog posts from YouTube transcripts. After some experimentation, I settled on a process using the YouTube Transcript API and OpenAI’s Python API. This allowed me to repurpose existing code, speeding up development.

While I could have added more advanced features—like PDF uploads or fine-tuning a model on my own content—I chose to focus on a minimal viable product (MVP) that could be iterated on later.

### Deployment and Launch

**What good is an app if it’s stuck on your computer?**

Day four was all about deployment. I set up Google OAuth for user sign-in, which simplified user management and enhanced security. After purchasing a custom domain for $70 through Squarespace, I deployed the app on Railway, taking advantage of their documentation for Fast HTML apps. After a few hiccups, I successfully launched my app.

I tested the early version by creating a blog post for a podcast I hosted last year. Typically, drafting a blog would take me an hour, but with this tool, I completed it in just five minutes. In just one day of monetization on Medium, I earned $112—proof that this project had tangible value.

### Key Takeaways

Building a web app in four days might seem ambitious, but it’s increasingly feasible with the right tools. Here are three key lessons from my experience:

- **Leverage Your Strengths:** Build with what you know. If I had to learn a new language or framework, I would still be watching tutorials.
- **Utilize AI Tools:** Coding assistants like Cursor and ChatGPT can dramatically speed up your development process. If you’re not using them, you might be working twice as hard.
- **Focus on Ideas and Marketing:** The success of a product hinges not just on its development but also on the idea behind it and how it’s marketed. Solve your own problems to increase the likelihood of validation.

### Moving Forward

In just four days, I transitioned from concept to deployment, illustrating how modern tools can accelerate the development process. If you’re considering launching your own project, start by identifying a problem you face, leverage existing skills, and don’t hesitate to use AI technology to enhance your workflow.
