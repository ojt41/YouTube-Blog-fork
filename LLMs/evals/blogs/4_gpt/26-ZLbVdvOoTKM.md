# Building Large Language Models from Scratch

### A Practical Guide for Developers

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, building large language models (LLMs) has shifted from a niche activity reserved for elite researchers to a mainstream endeavor pursued by businesses and organizations worldwide. This article explores the critical considerations and steps involved in constructing an LLM from scratch, providing insights into when it might be necessary to undertake this complex task.

Just a year ago, the prospect of creating a large language model seemed daunting and esoteric. However, with the explosion of interest following models like ChatGPT, many organizations are now eager to explore this technology. A notable example is Bloomberg, which developed Bloomberg GPT to address specific tasks in finance. Yet, for most use cases, building a model from scratch may not be necessary. Leveraging existing models through techniques like prompt engineering or fine-tuning can often yield better results.

### The Cost of Building LLMs

Before diving into the technical aspects, let's consider the financial implications. Training a large language model is resource-intensive. For instance, Meta's Llama 2 model provides a useful baseline. The 7 billion parameter version required approximately 180,000 GPU hours, while the 70 billion parameter version needed around 1.7 million GPU hours. Translating this into costs, renting GPUs from cloud providers can cost between $1 to $2 per hour. Thus, training a 10 billion parameter model could cost around $150,000, while a 100 billion parameter model may reach $1.5 million.

Alternatively, purchasing hardware for a large-scale training operation is another route. A single A100 GPU costs about $110,000, and forming a cluster of 1,000 GPUs could set you back around $10 million. Additionally, energy costs must be factored in, potentially adding another $100,000 for a 100 billion parameter model.

### Four Key Steps to Build an LLM

Building a large language model can be distilled into four essential steps: data curation, model architecture, training at scale, and evaluation.

#### Data Curation

**Quality is King.** The adage "garbage in, garbage out" holds especially true for machine learning. The quality of your model is directly tied to the quality of your training data. Large language models require vast datasets; for example, GPT-3 was trained on half a trillion tokens, while Llama 2 used two trillion tokens.

But where do you source this data? The internet is a primary resource, encompassing everything from web pages to scientific articles. However, legal and ethical considerations around copyright and data ownership complicate matters. Public datasets like Common Crawl and Hugging Face's repositories can be beneficial. Additionally, proprietary datasets, such as FinPile for Bloomberg GPT, offer unique advantages.

**Diversity is Essential.** A diverse dataset not only improves the model's generalizability but also enhances its performance across various tasks. Models like GPT-3 and Llama 2 showcase different compositions of training data, emphasizing the importance of including a variety of sources.

#### Model Architecture

**Transformers Lead the Way.** The architecture of your model is crucial. Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms, have become the standard for large language models. These mechanisms help capture the relationships between different elements in a sequence, allowing the model to understand context effectively.

There are three primary types of Transformers: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. The decoder-only architecture is particularly popular for language modeling tasks, as it predicts future tokens based on previous ones.

**Design Choices Matter.** Within the Transformer architecture, developers have a range of design choices, including:
- **Residual Connections:** These allow intermediate values to bypass layers, enhancing training efficiency.
- **Layer Normalization:** This technique stabilizes training by standardizing inputs across layers.
- **Activation Functions:** Non-linear functions like GELU or ReLU enable the model to capture complex mappings between inputs and outputs.

#### Training at Scale

**Navigating Complexity.** Training large language models involves significant computational challenges. Techniques such as mixed precision training, which utilizes both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point numbers, can help reduce resource consumption. Additionally, 3D parallelism combines pipeline, model, and data parallelism to optimize training across multiple GPUs.

**Stability is Key.** Ensuring stable training is critical. Strategies like checkpointing allow you to save model states, making it easier to recover from errors. Regularization techniques such as weight decay and gradient clipping help prevent issues like overfitting and exploding gradients.

#### Model Evaluation

**Testing for Performance.** After investing significant time and resources into training your model, evaluating its performance is vital. Benchmark datasets like the Open LLM Leaderboard provide a framework for assessing model capabilities across various tasks.

Evaluation strategies vary based on the nature of the task. For multiple-choice tasks, prompt templates can guide the model to produce the expected output format. For open-ended tasks, human evaluation or auxiliary models can provide quality assessments.

### Whatâ€™s Next?

Building a large language model is just the beginning. The real work often lies in refining the model for specific applications. Techniques like prompt engineering and model fine-tuning can help tailor the model to meet particular needs.

As the field of AI continues to evolve, understanding the intricacies of LLM development will be crucial for those looking to leverage this powerful technology. Whether you're considering building your own model or simply looking to utilize existing ones, the insights shared here will guide your journey into the world of large language models.
