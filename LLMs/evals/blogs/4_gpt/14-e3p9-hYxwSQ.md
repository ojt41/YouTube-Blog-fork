# Learn AI by Doing: A Practical Guide

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed significantly over the past few years, and the abundance of learning resources can be both a blessing and a curse. If you're feeling overwhelmed about where to start your AI journey, you’re not alone. In this article, I’ll share a structured approach to learning AI that emphasizes hands-on experience, leveraging the latest tools and resources available today.

## The Challenge of Learning AI

When I began my journey in AI six years ago, I was a researcher pursuing my PhD. Since then, I’ve transitioned into roles as a data scientist at Toyota and now as a teacher and product builder in the AI space. What I’ve learned is that the best way to absorb complex concepts is through practical application. 

Many newcomers face the same dilemma: with countless courses, tutorials, and tools at your fingertips, where do you even begin? The answer lies in a simple principle: **learn by doing**. Instead of passively consuming information, engage with tasks that require you to apply what you learn. 

### Start with AI Tools

If I were starting from scratch today, my first step would be to familiarize myself with modern AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude. Regular interaction with these tools provides a practical understanding of their capabilities and helps you develop effective prompting skills.

**Why do this?** Because these chat interfaces are not just for casual conversation; they are powerful learning aids. Use them to clarify confusing terms like LLMs, tokens, APIs, and RAG. Don’t hesitate to ask follow-up questions until you fully grasp each concept. If you hit a wall, Google and YouTube are excellent alternatives for finding explanations.

### Install Python

Once you’ve gained some familiarity with AI tools, it’s time to get hands-on. The next step is to install Python, the industry standard for AI development. You can easily find step-by-step instructions through ChatGPT. If you encounter issues, don’t be shy about asking for help. 

This step is crucial because it sets the foundation for your coding journey. Understanding each part of the installation process helps you avoid future technical debt—those pesky problems that arise from a lack of understanding.

### Build Simple Automations

With Python up and running, you’re ready to start building simple automations. Think about tasks you frequently use AI for and try to replicate them in Python. This requires getting comfortable with OpenAI's Python API, so dive into their documentation and study example code. 

For instance, if you want to summarize research papers, the steps might look like this:

1. Read the paper content into Python.
2. Construct a prompt for GPT-4.
3. Make an OpenAI API call.

If you get stuck, return to ChatGPT for assistance. Ask it to explain any code snippets you don’t understand, ensuring you grasp each line. This method helps you avoid the trap of blindly copying code without comprehension.

### Tackle More Complex Projects

Once you’re confident with basic automations, it’s time to level up. Seek out more sophisticated projects that require you to use embedding models or even train your own. The Hugging Face Transformers library is a fantastic resource for this. 

Potential project ideas include:

- Building a semantic search tool
- Creating a RAG chatbot
- Clustering documents based on similarity
- Training a text classifier using embeddings

For example, if you decide to pursue a RAG project, start by watching relevant YouTube videos and breaking down the system's components. Then, begin coding, with ChatGPT as your co-pilot to guide you through challenges.

### Solve Real-World Problems

The final step in your AI journey involves applying your skills to real-world problems. This can be done in two ways: solving your own problems or helping others. 

If you’ve already tackled personal projects, consider reaching out to business owners or professionals in your network. If you’re a student, joining a research group or seeking internships can provide invaluable experience. Freelancing on platforms like Upwork is another option to gain practical exposure.

If you’re unsure how to start, make a list of potential contacts—small business owners or professionals at medium-sized companies are ideal. Craft a message template and reach out via LinkedIn or email. If you struggle with wording, ChatGPT can help you craft the perfect message.

### Conclusion

Learning AI is undoubtedly challenging. You will face confusion and frustration along the way, but patience and persistence will lead to clarity. 

As you embark on this journey, remember that today’s tools and resources make AI more accessible than ever. Embrace the learning process, and don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it.
