# Fine-Tune Large Language Models on Your Mac

### A Simple Guide for Mac Users

With the rise of open-source models and efficient fine-tuning methods, building custom machine learning (ML) solutions has never been easier. Anyone with just a single GPU can fine-tune a large language model (LLM) right on their local machine. But what if you're a Mac user? This guide will show you how to fine-tune an LLM locally on your Mac, using tools designed specifically for Apple silicon.

### The Challenge for Mac Users

For years, NVIDIA GPUs have dominated the machine learning landscape, enabling efficient training and deployment of models. Their powerful hardware has propelled NVIDIA's market valuation from $100 billion to $3 trillion in just five years. However, this dominance has created a gap for Mac users, who often find themselves sidelined due to the lack of compatible tools and libraries.

In a previous video, I attempted to fine-tune a model using Google Colab's free GPUs, but the experience was restrictive and inconvenient. After several unsuccessful attempts to fine-tune LLaMA 2 on my M1 Mac Mini, I discovered the MLX Python library, a game-changer for Apple silicon users.

### Enter MLX: The Solution

MLX, developed by Apple's machine learning research team, is designed for efficient matrix operations on Apple silicon. Unlike traditional frameworks that separate RAM and VRAM, MLX utilizes the unified memory model of M1 chips. This means that even with a modest 16 GB of memory, you can successfully fine-tune large language models on your local machine.

While MLX is a low-level framework lacking high-level abstractions like Hugging Face, it provides a flexible foundation for model training. For this guide, I will demonstrate how to fine-tune a quantized version of the Mistral 7B instruct model to respond to YouTube comments in my style.

### Getting Started with MLX

To begin, you will need to clone the GitHub repository containing the necessary code and data. Here’s how:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   ```
   Navigate to the `llm` subdirectory where the example code resides.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Create a new Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv mlx_env
   source mlx_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Fine-Tuning the Model

After setting up your environment, it's time to fine-tune the model. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

#### Preparing the Data

You'll need a dataset formatted in JSONL, which consists of comments paired with responses. For this example, I prepared a dataset of 70 real YouTube comments and responses, dividing them into training (50), testing (10), and validation (10) sets.

```json
{"text": "Great content! Thank you!", "response": "I'm glad you enjoyed it!"}
```

#### Running the Fine-Tuning Script

With your data ready, you can start fine-tuning the model. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python scripts/lowra.py --model mistal-7B-instruct --train --iterations 100 --batch_size 4 --learning_rate 1e-5
```

This command specifies the model to use, the training flag, the number of iterations, batch size, and learning rate. Adjust these parameters as needed based on your machine's capabilities.

### Evaluating the Results

Once training is complete, you can test the model's performance. The trained model should now generate responses that resemble my style. For example, when given the comment "Great content! Thank you!", the model might respond with:

"Thanks for the kind words! I'm thrilled you found it helpful."

This is a significant improvement from the untrained model, which produced verbose and less personal replies. 

### Conclusion: Take Action

Fine-tuning large language models on your Mac is not only possible but also straightforward with the right tools. The MLX library empowers Mac users to leverage their hardware for machine learning tasks efficiently. 

If you're ready to dive into the world of custom ML solutions, start by cloning the repository and experimenting with the provided code. As you explore, remember that machine learning is as much art as it is science. Don't hesitate to tweak parameters and adapt the code to fit your unique needs.
