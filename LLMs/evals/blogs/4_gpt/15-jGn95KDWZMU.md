# Five Essential Questions for Data Scientists

### Master Problem Discovery in Data Science

Data science is often seen as a realm dominated by complex algorithms and sophisticated tools. However, at its core, data science is about solving real-world problems. The challenge lies in the fact that many data science projects begin without a clearly defined problem, making it crucial for data scientists to ask the right questions. In this article, we'll explore five fundamental questions that every data scientist should internalize to excel in problem identification and definition.

When I first embarked on my data science journey, I was consumed by the allure of mastering tools and technologies. While a solid technical foundation is essential, I quickly learned that focusing too much on tools can lead to what I call the "hammer problem." This is when you have a shiny new hammer, and suddenly, everything looks like a nail. Unfortunately, this often results in projects that are intellectually engaging but ultimately ineffective.

The real turning point for me came when I joined a data science team at a large enterprise. There, I discovered the importance of prioritizing problem-solving over technology. Understanding the business context before writing a single line of code is vital. If you don’t grasp the problem at hand, you risk wasting time and resources on the wrong solutions. This is where effective problem discovery questions come into play.

### What Problem Are You Solving?

The first question to ask is deceptively simple: **What problem are you trying to solve?** In theory, this should be the only question you need. However, in practice, clients often struggle to articulate their problems clearly. Even when they do, a deeper understanding of the business context is usually necessary. This question serves as a springboard for further inquiry.

For example, if a client mentions they attempted to create a chatbot using OpenAI but were dissatisfied with the results, I might follow up with, **What was the chatbot used for?** or **What makes you say the results weren't good?** If I'm at a loss for follow-up questions, I find that rephrasing and summarizing the client's statements can keep the conversation flowing and reveal more about their challenges.

### Why Is This Important?

Once you’ve identified the problem, the next logical question is **Why?** This question can unlock a wealth of insights into the client's motivations, goals, and underlying assumptions. However, be cautious—why questions can sometimes make clients defensive. To mitigate this, consider rephrasing the question. Here are some alternatives:

- Why is this important to your business?
- Why do you want to solve this now?
- What does solving this mean for your business?

These variations can lead to deeper discussions that help pinpoint the root cause of the issue. This approach is reminiscent of Toyota's "Five Whys," which encourages digging deeper into problems by repeatedly asking why.

### What's Your Dream Outcome?

After understanding the problem and its significance, it’s time to explore the client's aspirations with the question: **What’s your dream outcome?** This question effectively combines the what and why, prompting clients to articulate their vision for the project. 

To further clarify their expectations, you can ask related questions such as:
- What does success look like?
- How would we measure it?

These inquiries transition the conversation from abstract goals to concrete metrics, setting the stage for actionable solutions.

### What Have You Tried?

Understanding what has already been attempted can save valuable time and resources. This leads us to the question: **What have you tried so far?** This inquiry serves two purposes: it helps avoid repeating past mistakes and encourages building upon existing efforts. 

If the client hasn’t attempted any solutions, consider asking:
- What is the existing solution?
- How do you solve this problem now?
- What have others done to tackle similar issues?

These questions help frame the project and prevent unnecessary reinvention of the wheel.

### Why Me?

The final question, inspired by master negotiator Chris Voss, is **Why me?** This question can reveal the client's motivations for engaging with you. It often sparks additional context about their needs and expectations, which can be crucial for determining next steps.

Sometimes, clients may struggle to answer this question, which could indicate that they are not genuinely interested in collaborating. They might be seeking free consulting or looking for competing bids. Recognizing these signs can save you from pursuing unproductive engagements.

### Key Takeaways

Over the past six months, I’ve learned that these questions should be hardcoded into your brain but not rigidly followed. The goal is not to mechanically work through a checklist but to allow these questions to arise naturally during conversations.

Here are three actionable takeaways to enhance your problem-discovery skills:

1. **Practice These Questions**: Don’t just study them—use them in real conversations. Expect some awkward moments; they’re part of the learning curve.
   
2. **Stay Curious**: The aim of these early-stage discussions is to learn, not to showcase your expertise or make a sale.
   
3. **Listen More**: My rule of thumb is to wait until the last 5-10 minutes of a call to start offering recommendations. Prioritize asking questions and actively listening to your clients.
