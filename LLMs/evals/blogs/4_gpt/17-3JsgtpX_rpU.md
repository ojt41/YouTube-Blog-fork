# AI Use Cases for Sales Improvement

### Exploring Practical Applications of Large Language Models

In today’s competitive business landscape, leveraging AI is no longer optional; it’s essential. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become powerful tools, yet many businesses struggle to identify how to use these technologies effectively. This article explores three AI use cases specifically tailored to enhance sales processes, providing actionable insights and real-world examples.

Businesses often default to building chatbots or virtual assistants when considering AI solutions. While these tools can address specific challenges, they are not one-size-fits-all solutions. The unpredictability of LLMs poses significant challenges, often leading to costly missteps. In this article, we will explore three practical AI applications that go beyond chatbots: data augmentation, structuring unstructured data, and lead scoring.

### Data Augmentation

**What is data augmentation, and why does it matter?**

Data augmentation involves enhancing your existing dataset by adding new information. This can take the form of either new variables (more columns) or new examples (more rows). For businesses, the value of data augmentation lies in its ability to inform decision-making and improve machine learning models.

Imagine a company analyzing resumes to identify potential hires. Instead of manually extracting information like years of experience or industry from each resume—an impractical task when dealing with thousands of documents—AI can automate this process. For example, a popular data vendor, FICO, generates credit scores that help financial institutions make lending decisions. By augmenting datasets with AI, businesses can enhance their analytics and ultimately drive better outcomes.

### Structuring Unstructured Data

**Why is structuring unstructured data crucial for analysis?**

Unstructured data, such as text documents, images, or audio files, lacks a predefined format, making it challenging to analyze. In contrast, structured data—organized in rows and columns—allows for easier extraction of insights. Large language models excel in transforming unstructured data into structured formats through techniques like text embeddings.

Text embeddings convert chunks of text into numerical representations, enabling businesses to organize and analyze data more effectively. For instance, using embeddings to analyze resumes can help identify key skills and experiences, leading to more informed hiring decisions.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(resume_texts)
```

### Lead Scoring

**What is lead scoring, and how can AI improve it?**

Lead scoring predicts the likelihood of a potential customer making a purchase based on various data points such as job title, company revenue, and engagement metrics. While lead scoring is not a new concept, LLMs enhance the process by improving the quality of the inputs used in scoring models.

For example, a business may collect data from outreach efforts to determine which leads are most promising. By analyzing responses to outreach messages, a company can refine its approach and focus on high-potential leads. This process involves training models to assess the probability of a lead saying "yes" or "no" to an offer, ultimately guiding sales strategies.

### Case Study: Applying AI to Validate Workshop Ideas

To illustrate these concepts, let’s consider a case study from my own experience. I recently reached out to 100 individuals on LinkedIn to gauge interest in AI workshops. The outreach resulted in 58 responses, with 18 indicating they would attend. By analyzing the data, I identified promising customer avatars—IT professionals, consultants, and data analysts—as the most interested parties.

Using the three AI use cases discussed, I structured the analysis as follows:

1. **Data Augmentation**: I extracted text from resumes using a Python script, identifying key information like years of experience.
2. **Structuring Unstructured Data**: I employed text embeddings to convert resumes into a structured format for analysis.
3. **Lead Scoring**: I trained models to predict the likelihood of individuals attending the workshops based on their resumes and responses.

Through this analysis, I discovered that IT professionals were the most promising leads, aligning with my initial intuitions.

### Conclusion

Leveraging AI in sales processes can yield significant benefits. By focusing on data augmentation, structuring unstructured data, and lead scoring, businesses can enhance their decision-making capabilities and drive sales growth. As AI technology continues to evolve, the potential for innovative applications will only expand.

**Takeaway**: Embrace AI as a strategic tool in your sales arsenal, and consider how these use cases can be integrated into your operations. The future of sales is not just about technology; it’s about using technology to understand and serve your customers better.
