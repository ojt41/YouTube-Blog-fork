### Title: From Zero to Web App in Four Days: My Journey to Building a YouTube to Blog Converter
#### Subtitle: How I transformed an idea into a working prototype without prior web development experience.

In a world where technology evolves at lightning speed, the ability to turn ideas into functional products has never been more accessible. Recently, I embarked on a thrilling journey to create a web app that translates YouTube videos into blog posts—all within just four days! With no prior web development experience, I faced the challenge head-on, and I’m here to share my process, the tools I used, and the lessons learned along the way.

### Day 1: Ideation and Design

The first day was all about brainstorming and laying the groundwork. My background is in data science, which means I’m comfortable with programming but had never ventured into building consumer software. To kickstart my project, I turned to advice from Steven Wolfram: *build a product that solves your own problems*. This led me to three potential ideas:

1. A YouTube thumbnail generator.
2. A YouTube clip finder.
3. A YouTube video to blog converter.

After some research and experimenting with ChatGPT, I decided on the last idea. I felt it was the quickest to implement and saw a job on Upwork that validated my concept.

Next, I focused on designing the user interface. With no coding knowledge, I created a brand blueprint, which included:

- **Color Palette**: I used a tool called Cooler to select colors.
- **Fonts**: Carefully chosen to enhance readability.
- **Logo**: Designed in Canva to give the app a professional touch.

By the end of Day 1, I had a clear vision of what my app would look like.

### Day 2: Frontend Development

On Day 2, it was time to bring my design to life. I aimed to implement the front end using a language I was comfortable with: Python. Fortunately, I discovered a new library called FastHTML, which allows developers to build web apps in Python seamlessly.

Here’s how I approached the frontend development:

- **Learning FastHTML**: I spent the morning watching tutorials and reading documentation.
- **Coding**: I took a screenshot of my design and used it as a reference to start coding the frontend.
- **AI Assistance**: I utilized coding assistants like Cursor and ChatGPT to help with CSS styling and troubleshooting.

By the end of Day 2, I had a functional website that mirrored my original design.

### Day 3: Backend Development

With the frontend in place, Day 3 was dedicated to backend development. I needed to implement the functionality to convert YouTube transcripts into blog posts. I started by crafting a prompt in ChatGPT to generate blog content based on video transcripts. 

Key tools I used included:

- **YouTube Transcript API**: To fetch video transcripts.
- **OpenAI’s Python API**: For generating coherent blog posts.

Thanks to my previous experience with these libraries, I was able to repurpose code from past projects, making the process much smoother.

### Day 4: Deployment

The final day was all about getting my app online. I set up Google OAuth for user authentication, which simplified user management and security. After a few hiccups with deployment, I successfully launched my app on Railway and purchased a custom domain.

Here’s what I achieved by the end of Day 4:

- A working prototype that could convert YouTube videos into blog posts.
- A monetized blog post that generated $112 in just one day!

### Key Takeaways

Reflecting on this whirlwind experience, I learned three crucial lessons that can help anyone looking to embark on a similar journey:

1. **Build with What You Know**: Leveraging existing skills can accelerate the development process. Had I needed to learn JavaScript or React from scratch, I might still be stuck in tutorials!
   
2. **Embrace AI Tools**: Coding assistants like Cursor and ChatGPT are game-changers. They can significantly reduce the time spent on coding and debugging.

3. **Focus on Ideas and Marketing**: While building is essential, validating your idea and figuring out how to market it is equally important. Solve your own problems, and you’ll likely find others who share the same needs.
