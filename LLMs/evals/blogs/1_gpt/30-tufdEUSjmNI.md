#### Subtitle: How Can We Infer Cause and Effect from Data?

In the vast landscape of data analysis, understanding causality remains one of the most challenging yet fascinating endeavors. In this final installment of our three-part series on causality, we delve into the realm of causal discovery—a method that aims to infer causal structures from data. Whether you’re a data scientist, researcher, or simply curious about the intricacies of cause and effect, this post will guide you through the fundamental concepts, techniques, and practical applications of causal discovery.

### What is Causal Discovery?

Causal discovery is a process that seeks to identify causal relationships between variables using observational data. Unlike causal inference, which relies on predefined causal models, causal discovery attempts to construct these models from scratch. This is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the underlying causal relationships are unknown.

#### The Inverse Problem

To grasp the essence of causal discovery, consider the analogy of an ice cube melting into a puddle. While you can predict the puddle's shape based on the ice cube's dimensions, the reverse—inferring the ice cube's shape from the puddle—is much more complex. Similarly, in causal discovery, we aim to deduce the causal model (the ice cube) from the observed data (the puddle).

### Key Techniques in Causal Discovery

To navigate the complexities of causal discovery, researchers employ various techniques. Here are three notable strategies:

#### 1. Conditional Independence Testing

Conditional independence testing is a foundational technique in causal discovery. It assesses whether two variables are independent when conditioned on a third variable. This concept is pivotal in algorithms like the PC algorithm, which operates in the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Form a fully connected undirected graph representing all variables.
- **Step 2**: Perform pairwise independence tests to remove edges between independent variables.
- **Step 3**: Conduct conditional independence tests to refine the graph further.
- **Step 4**: Orient colliders to establish directional relationships.
- **Step 5**: Add directed edges while avoiding cycles, resulting in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

#### 2. Greedy Search of the DAG Space

Given the exponential growth of possible DAGs with increasing variables, exhaustive searches become impractical. Instead, a greedy search strategy is employed to find a satisfactory solution quickly. The Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm exemplifies this approach, starting with an unconnected DAG and iteratively adding edges based on a scoring system, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion.

#### 3. Exploiting Asymmetry

Asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of causality, and it can be leveraged in several ways:

- **Time Asymmetry**: Causes precede effects, as seen in Granger causality.
- **Complexity Asymmetry**: Simpler models are preferred, aligning with Occam's Razor.
- **Functional Asymmetry**: Better functional fits serve as stronger candidates for causal models, as demonstrated in non-linear additive noise models.

### A Practical Example of Causal Discovery

To illustrate these concepts, let's consider an analysis using a census dataset. We will explore how different causal discovery algorithms perform in identifying relationships between variables such as age, education, and income.

1. **PC Algorithm**: This method produced a causal graph indicating that having a graduate degree influences income, but surprisingly suggested that education impacts age, which is illogical.
   
2. **Greedy Equivalence Search**: This algorithm provided a more coherent causal graph, breaking the symmetry observed in the previous method.

3. **Lingam Algorithm**: Unfortunately, this approach yielded nonsensical results, attributing causality incorrectly, likely due to its reliance on linear relationships.

These examples underscore the importance of choosing the right algorithm for causal discovery, as different methods can yield vastly different insights.

### Conclusion

Causal discovery is an evolving field that holds immense potential for understanding the intricate web of relationships within data. While various techniques offer promising avenues for exploration, it’s crucial to recognize that no single method is universally superior. As we continue to develop and refine these approaches, the quest to uncover the truth behind cause and effect remains an exciting frontier in data science.
