# Building a YouTube Video to Blog Post Converter in Just Four Days
### How I Transformed an Idea into a Working Prototype with Minimal Experience

As a data scientist, I often find myself knee-deep in data processing and machine learning, but when it comes to building consumer software, I felt like a fish out of water. However, with my savings dwindling, I decided to tackle this challenge head-on by creating a web app that converts YouTube videos into blog posts. Surprisingly, I managed to build and deploy the initial prototype in just four days! In this post, Iâ€™ll share my journey, the tools I used, and the lessons I learned along the way.

### Day 1: Ideation and Design

On the first day, I was starting from scratch. My goal was clear: ship a product in less than a month, but I needed a solid idea. Drawing inspiration from Steven Wolfram's advice to "build a product that solves your own problems," I brainstormed three potential projects:

- A YouTube thumbnail generator
- A YouTube clip finder
- A YouTube video to blog converter

After some quick research, I decided on the last idea, as it seemed the most feasible to implement quickly. With my concept in place, I pivoted to designing the website and user interface. 

Since I lacked coding skills, I began by creating a brand blueprint, which included:

- A color palette (using [Cooler](https://coolors.co))
- Font selections
- A logo designed in [Canva](https://www.canva.com)

By the end of Day 1, I had a clear vision of the app's interface.

### Day 2: Frontend Development

Day 2 was dedicated to implementing the frontend based on my Canva design. Given my limited experience with web development, I opted to use **Fast HTML**, a Python library that allows developers to build web applications without diving deep into HTML and JavaScript. 

I spent the morning learning Fast HTML through a lecture and its documentation. In the afternoon, I began coding the frontend, using a screenshot of my design as a reference. My workflow involved:

1. Using [Cursor](https://cursor.so) to assist with coding.
2. Occasionally consulting ChatGPT for CSS styling help.

By the end of the day, I had a frontend that closely resembled my initial design.

```python
# Example of a simple Fast HTML structure
from fasthtml import FastHTML

app = FastHTML()

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "<h1>Welcome to YouTube to Blog Converter</h1>"

app.run()
```

### Day 3: Backend Implementation

With the frontend ready, Day 3 focused on implementing the backend functionality. I utilized the **YouTube Transcript API** and OpenAI's Python API to generate blog posts from video transcripts. My approach involved:

- Crafting a prompt in ChatGPT to create blog posts based on transcripts.
- Experimenting with various YouTube videos to refine the output.

The beauty of this approach was that I could repurpose existing code from previous projects, which accelerated the development process. 

While I could have added more sophisticated features, such as user-uploaded PDFs or fine-tuning a model on my own content, I chose to keep it simple for the prototype.

### Day 4: Deployment

The final day was all about deployment. To make the app accessible, I set up **Google OAuth** for user authentication, allowing users to sign in with their Google accounts. This saved me from managing sensitive information like passwords. 

After several attempts, I successfully deployed the app using [Railway](https://railway.app), a platform that simplifies app deployment. I also purchased a custom domain for the app, which added a professional touch.

By the end of Day 4, I had a working prototype that allowed users to create blog posts from YouTube videos in mere minutes. I even monetized the first blog post on Medium, earning $112 within a day!

### Key Takeaways and Next Steps

Reflecting on this whirlwind experience, here are three essential tips for aspiring developers:

1. **Build with What You Know**: Leverage your existing skills to minimize learning curves. If I had to learn JavaScript or React, I would still be stuck in tutorials.
   
2. **Utilize AI Tools**: Coding assistants like Cursor and ChatGPT can significantly speed up your development process, making you more efficient.

3. **Focus on Ideas and Marketing**: While building is crucial, the idea's viability and effective marketing strategies are equally important.
