# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models Locally on Mac
### A Comprehensive Guide to Using MLX for Efficient Model Training

With the rapid advancements in open-source machine learning frameworks, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly accessible. In this post, I’ll walk you through the process of fine-tuning a large language model on a Mac, specifically utilizing the MLX library developed by Apple. This guide is tailored for those who want to run LLMs locally without the need for an Nvidia GPU, making it perfect for Mac users.

### Why Fine-Tune Locally?

Fine-tuning LLMs can enhance their performance on specific tasks, such as generating responses that align more closely with your personal style or brand voice. Traditionally, this process required powerful GPUs, often leading users to rely on cloud platforms like Google Colab. However, with MLX, you can harness the power of Apple Silicon to run these models directly on your local machine.

Here’s what we aim to achieve:
- Fine-tune a quantized version of the Mistral 7B model to respond to YouTube comments in my voice.
- Utilize MLX to leverage the unified memory architecture of M1 chips, allowing for efficient training without the need for extensive hardware resources.

### Getting Started with MLX

Before diving into the code, let's set up our environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the GitHub repository containing the example code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   cd yourrepo/llm
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It’s essential to keep dependencies organized.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv mlx_env
   source mlx_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required libraries.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Ensure that you are using a native Python version greater than or equal to 3.8 and running macOS 13.5 or higher.

### Understanding MLX

MLX is a Python library designed for efficient matrix operations on Apple Silicon. It allows you to utilize the unified memory model of M1 chips, simplifying memory management. This is particularly beneficial for training large models where RAM and VRAM are typically treated separately.

### Fine-Tuning the Model

Now, let's walk through the fine-tuning process step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

For this example, we’ll use a dataset of YouTube comments and corresponding responses. The data needs to be formatted in JSON Lines (JSONL) format, which consists of key-value pairs where each line is a JSON object.

Here’s how you can prepare your dataset:

```python
import json

# Sample data preparation
comments = [
    {"text": "Great content! Thank you."},
    {"text": "This was really helpful!"}
]

with open('data.jsonl', 'w') as f:
    for comment in comments:
        f.write(json.dumps(comment) + '\n')
```

#### Step 2: Fine-Tune the Model

To initiate the fine-tuning process, we’ll run a Python script using the MLX library. Here’s a simplified command that you can adapt based on your needs:

```bash
python scripts/fine_tune.py --model mistal-7B-instruct --train_file data.jsonl --iterations 100 --learning_rate 1e-5
```

This command specifies:
- The model to fine-tune.
- The training dataset.
- The number of training iterations and the learning rate.

#### Step 3: Running Inference

After fine-tuning, you can test the model's performance with new comments. Here’s how to generate a response:

```python
from mlx import MLXLM

model = MLXLM.load('path/to/your/fine-tuned/model')
response = model.generate("What a fantastic video!")
print(response)
```

This snippet loads the fine-tuned model and generates a response to the provided comment.
