### What is Python?

At its core, Python is a programming language that allows you to instruct computers to perform tasks that may be tedious or complex. For instance, after a consulting call, instead of spending hours drafting follow-up emails, you could automate this process with a Python script. The beauty of Python lies in its versatility—there are very few limitations on what you can create. 

With the advent of tools like Google and ChatGPT, learning to code has never been easier. Need to send emails automatically? A quick search on Google or a prompt in ChatGPT can provide you with step-by-step guidance, complete with example code. These tools tap into collective knowledge, making coding more accessible than ever.

### Who This Guide is For

This tutorial is crafted for individuals who have some coding experience but are new to Python. If you're looking to transition into AI and data science, you're in the right place. Our goal is not to provide an exhaustive overview of Python but to equip you with just enough knowledge to kickstart your first AI project.

### Getting Started with Python

Before we dive into coding, the first step is to ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Most computers come with Python pre-installed, but if you need to install it, you can easily download it from the official Python website or consider using Anaconda, a popular package manager for data science.

Once you have Python set up, let’s explore some fundamental concepts.

#### Data Types: The Building Blocks of Python

Understanding data types is crucial, as they help classify data so it can be processed efficiently. Here are some key data types you'll encounter:

- **Strings**: Sequences of characters. You can create strings using single or double quotes. For instance, `hello` and `'hello'` are both valid strings.
- **Integers and Floats**: Integers are whole numbers (e.g., 1, 42), while floats are numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14).
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of values, which can include mixed data types. For example, `my_list = [1, "AI", 3.14]`.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs that allow you to store data in a structured way. For example, `my_dict = {"name": "Shaw", "age": 29}`.

Understanding these data types will lay the foundation for your Python programming.

### Writing Your First Python Script

To write a Python script, you can use a simple text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code or PyCharm. For your first program, let’s create a classic “Hello, World!” script:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save this code in a file with a `.py` extension, and run it through your terminal. You’ll see your program greet you!

### Control Structures: Loops and Conditions

Once you’ve grasped the basics, it’s time to learn about control structures, which allow you to dictate the flow of your programs.

- **Loops**: These let you run a block of code multiple times. A common loop is the `for` loop, which iterates over a sequence:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

- **Conditional Statements**: These allow you to execute code based on certain conditions. For example:

```python
age = 29
if age >= 18:
    print("User is an adult.")
else:
    print("User is a minor.")
```

These structures are foundational for building more complex logic in your programs.

### Functions: Organizing Your Code

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help keep your code organized and efficient. Here’s an example of a simple function that greets a user:

```python
def greet(user_name):
    return f"Hello, {user_name}!"
```

You can call this function with a user's name to get a personalized greeting.

### Building Your First AI Project: A Research Paper Summarizer

Now that you have a grasp of Python basics, let’s apply your knowledge in a practical AI project: a research paper summarizer and keyword extractor. 

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. This helps keep your libraries organized and prevents conflicts:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the necessary libraries using a `requirements.txt` file, which lists all required packages.

#### Step 2: Extracting Text from PDFs

Use libraries like `PyMuPDF` to extract text from PDFs. Here’s a function to get the abstract from a research paper:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_abstract(pdf_path):
    # Extract text and find the abstract
    ...
```

#### Step 3: Summarizing and Extracting Keywords

Utilize the OpenAI API to summarize the extracted abstract and generate keywords. Here’s how you might structure the API call:

```python
import openai

def summarize_and_extract_keywords(abstract):
    prompt = f"Summarize the following paper abstract and generate no more than five keywords: {abstract}"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

#### Step 4: Bringing It All Together

Finally, combine all the functions to create a complete script that accepts a PDF file path, extracts the abstract, and summarizes it.
