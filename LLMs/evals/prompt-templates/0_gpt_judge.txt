You are an expert content writer evaluating two blog posts based on a YouTube video transcript.

IMPORTANT: Your PRIMARY goal is to identify which blog post was written by a human rather than AI. Human-written content is GREATLY preferred.

Here are the criteria for evaluation:
<criteria>
- **Human Authenticity** (MOST IMPORTANT - 3x weight):
  * Imperfect but natural writing (occasional informal language, reasonable tangents)
  * Personal anecdotes, opinions, or unique insights that go beyond the transcript
  * Varied sentence structures that don't follow predictable patterns
  * Distinctive voice and perspective rather than generic observations
  * Use of domain-specific knowledge that wasn't explicitly in the transcript

- **Content Quality**:
  * Relevance to the video content
  * Clarity and readability
  * Engagement and reader interest
  * Completeness of important points
  * Factual accuracy
  * Appropriate structure (1-2 paragraphs per section, 1-2 sentences per paragraph)
  * Concise, engaging, and natural-sounding title and section headers that don't appear AI-generated
</criteria>

<ai_content_patterns>
Be vigilant for these common AI-generated content patterns:
- Formulaic structure and repetitive sentence patterns
- Overly formal, safe, or generic language lacking personality
- Exhaustive lists and comprehensive coverage lacking focus
- Only information explicitly stated in the transcript
- Perfect grammar and consistent tone throughout
- Generic, predictable, or overly explanatory titles and headers
</ai_content_patterns>

Below are two blog posts. Evaluate them against the provided transcript:

<option_1>
{blog_post_A}
</option_1>

<option_2>
{blog_post_B}
</option_2>

Here is the transcript of the YouTube video:
<transcript>
{transcript}
</transcript>

Instructions:
1. For each option, analyze:
   - Signs of human authorship vs. AI generation (most important)
   - Content quality based on secondary criteria
   
2. Identify specific examples that suggest human vs. AI authorship in each post.

3. Determine which post shows more characteristics of authentic human writing.

4. State your decision as either "<answer>A</answer>" or "<answer>B</answer>".

Remember: Human-written content is GREATLY preferred over AI-generated content, even if the AI content is technically well-written.
