# Prompt Template for Blog Post Generation

## Instructions for GPT-4o-mini:

You are tasked with generating a blog post from a YouTube transcript that closely mimics the style, tone, and formatting of authentic technical blog posts. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Title and Subtitle Structure**: 
   - Start with a clear, concise title using a # heading
   - Follow with a subtitle using ### or ## heading that provides context or frames the topic as a value proposition
   - Example: "# How to Build a Recommendation System" followed by "### A step-by-step guide for beginners"

2. **Introduction**:
   - Begin with 1-3 paragraphs that provide context and establish relevance
   - Clearly state the purpose of the article early on
   - Include a personal angle or connection to the topic when appropriate
   - Add a relevant image with proper attribution after the introduction

3. **Content Structure**:
   - Use "* * *" (horizontal rule) to separate major sections
   - Create clear section headings with ### or ## markdown
   - Keep paragraphs relatively short (2-5 sentences)
   - Use bullet points for lists of examples, resources, or steps
   - Include relevant code snippets when discussing technical implementations
   - Incorporate occasional bolded text for emphasis on key points

4. **Visual Elements**:
   - Include images with captions and proper attribution
   - Use simple diagrams or charts to illustrate concepts (described in markdown)
   - Format: ![Description](image_url)Caption or attribution

5. **Technical Depth**:
   - Balance technical explanations with practical applications
   - Define technical terms when first introduced
   - Include numbered references to external sources in brackets [1], [2], etc.
   - Link to related articles or resources using markdown links

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize key takeaways
   - Suggest next steps or applications
   - Avoid generic "thank you for reading" closings
   - End with a thought-provoking statement or call to action

7. **Voice and Tone**:
   - Write in first person when sharing personal experiences or opinions
   - Use a conversational but authoritative tone
   - Address the reader directly using "you" where appropriate
   - Maintain a balance between academic rigor and accessibility

## Example Structure:

# [Clear, Concise Title]
### [Framing Subtitle: Often a value proposition]

[1-3 paragraphs introducing the topic, establishing relevance, and stating the purpose of the article]

![Image description](image_url)Image attribution

* * *

### [First Major Section Heading]

[Content with short paragraphs and occasional **bold emphasis** on key points]

- [Bullet point for list items]
- [Another bullet point]

### [Second Major Section Heading]

[More content with practical examples or applications]

```python
# Code example if relevant
def example_function():
    return "Technical implementation"
```

* * *

### [Final Section or Conclusion]

[Summary of key points and takeaways]

[Thought-provoking closing statement or call to action]

* * *

## Transcript:

{transcript}

## Additional Notes:
- Focus on making the content valuable and insightful rather than just summarizing the transcript
- Maintain a natural flow between sections
- Include specific examples from the transcript but reorganize and enhance them
- Add relevant context or background information where needed
- Reference external sources with numbered citations [1], [2], etc.
- When appropriate, include a "Who is this for" or "Prerequisites" section early in the article
