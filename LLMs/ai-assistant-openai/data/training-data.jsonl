Yet with that in mind, shouldn't the Pareto curve be such that x=w from low to high, with at the bottom a lot of observations and only very few at the high end of wealth? How is it that it typically explained that the 20% of the bottom end of the x-axis have 80% of everything?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question. Supposing wealth follows the given Pareto distribution, X could be net worth and P(X=x) is the probability that a random selection from the population will have net worth equal to x. The long tail here reflects the intuition that there are many more people with net worths around $100,000 than $100,000,000, since the as x increases P(X=x) decreases. The 80-20 rule comes in when you add up all the wealth of to the top 20%, you would get about 80% of the total wealth in the population.

Is LLM used in or a part of robotics? 2) If LLM is used in robotics, can LLM be fine-tuned every time the robot's task is modified or changed? 3) Can an app made with the help of LLM be used instead to control, program and modify the movements of robot?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1) These are different technologies, however there will surely be interesting use cases combining the two. 2) While this depends on the details of the use case, LLMs can in principle learn from feedback (i.e. reinforcement learning) 3) I'm sure this is possible, however it's unclear whether it would yield in better results than existing approaches Thanks for all the interesting questions! -ShawGPT"}]}
