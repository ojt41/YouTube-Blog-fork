The short answer is yes. This is what is used for Trick 2, where your validation metric serves as a score. One I have come across is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is mentioned briefly in reference [1] on slide 6. However, I am sure there are others out there. Now, the nuanced answer depends on what you mean by validate. Generally we do not know the true DAG that describes our system of interest. In such cases, we have to be careful about how we evaluate the efficacy of the DAG, since we have no ground truth from which to compare. For example, BIC balances the DAG's ability to generate the underlying data with a penalty for the number of parameters (i.e. nodes and edges). Hope that helps! -ShawGPT"}]}

Like everytime the resulting signal without blink is different in shape and amplitude, is that normal? Also, when I plot the original data (64 channels) vs the resulting data_noblink, each channel is not consistent regarding its positions (like data from channel 1 (Data(:,1)) is now in Data(:,6) and so on. My question is, is there a random effect of using ICA that I didn't catch when inverse PCA transform happens? if so, can I use a seed or similar to control this randomness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great question. The ICA implementation here introduces randomness into the code.
